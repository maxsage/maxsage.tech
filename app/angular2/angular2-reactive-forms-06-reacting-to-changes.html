<h2>Reacting to Changes</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>With Reactive forms we can adjust how a form works reactively, based on user entries and selections. Welcome back to
    Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module we explore how to watch
    for user changes, and react to those changes dynamically controlling the form. What if we could watch every change
    that the user makes, every character, every keystroke? Yeah that might sound a bit creepy, but in Reactive forms
    it's a good thing, really. By watching the user's changes we can modify the display, the validation, or the
    messages, providing a much more dynamic and personal experience. In this module, we learn how to watch for user
    changes, we look at ways we can react to those changes, and we examine reactive transformations to improve how we
    watch those changes. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Watching</h3>

<p>The cool thing about Reactive forms is that we can easily watch for any changes happening to a FormControl or a
    FormGroup, and react to those changes in real time. Both FormControls and FormGroups have a valueChanges property,
    that allows us to watch for changes. The valueChanges property emits an event every time the value of a control
    changes, either in the user interface or programmatically. The valueChanges property is an observable of any. We can
    think of an observable as a collection of events that arrive asynchronously over time. The generic parameter is any,
    so the event in the collection can be of any type. We subscribe to the observable to watch the events. Similarly,
    there's a statusChanges property that emits events on changes to the validation state, but often the statusChanges
    is less useful because we want finer control. For example, if an input element is invalid, we don't want to display
    validation messages if the user has not yet touched or modified an input element, so we need more information than
    just a change in validation state. That's why we'll use valueChanges instead. To watch the events for a single
    FormControl, we subscribe to its valueChanges observable. Each time the control changes, an event is emitted, the
    FormControls current value is provided, and the associated code is executed. In this example, we simply log the
    FormControls value. We can also watch for events from any control within a nested FormGroup. By subscribing to the
    FormGroups valueChanges observable, each time any of the FormControls or other nested FormGroups within this
    FormGroup are changed, an event is emitted, the FormGroups value is provided, and the associated code is executed.
    Note that in this case, the value is the set of key and value pairs for all of the controls and nested FormGroups
    within this FormGroup. So here, we use the JSON.stringify to display the value. We can also watch for any change
    over the entire form by subscribing to the valueChanges property for the form's root FormGroup. This allows us to
    watch for any changes and any control on the form. Let's try this out. We only want to watch FormControls or
    FormGroups if we plan to do something when we see something. In our case, we want to do something whenever the user
    changes the Notification radio buttons. Currently, in the HTML, we bind to the click event of both notification
    radio buttons, and call a method in our component class. When the user clicks the text button, we add a required
    validation rule to the phone FormControl. When the user clicks the email button, we remove the validation rule from
    the phone FormControl. Let's implement this same feature by watching for changes instead of relying on event binding
    in the HTML. We'll begin by watching the send notification FormControl. We want to start watching as soon as the
    component is initialized, so we'll put the code in the ngOnInit method. Recall how we get the FormControl from the
    FormGroup? We'll use this.customerForm.get, and the name of the FormControl, which in this case is notification. We
    access the valueChanges property and call the subscribe on that observable to start watching for changes. We'll get
    an event every time either radio button changes. When a change occurs we get the value of the notification
    FormControl, for now we'll just log the value to the console. Note that this code must be after the definition of
    the root FormGroup, otherwise this reference is null. And this line is a little bit long, so let's break it up.
    Let's try it out in the browser. First, let's open the developer tools to view the console. Click Text and we see
    text logged to the console. Click Email, and email is logged to the console. The code is notified every time we
    change these radio buttons. We can subscribe to valueChanges on a FormControl as we've done here, or on any
    FormGroup, including the root FormGroup. Now that we know how to watch for changes, how can we react to those
    changes?</p>

<h3>Reacting: Adjusting Validation Rules</h3>

<p>As the user makes changes to the form, we can react to those changes to provide a more dynamic and customized
    experience. We can adjust the validation rules. We can handle validation messages in the component class instead of
    hardcoded in the template. We can adjust the user interface elements, adding or removing content as needed. We can
    provide automatic suggestions as the user types. The possibilities are limited only by our imaginations, and of
    course customer requirements. Let's see what we can do. Currently, our HTML binds to click events to notify us when
    the user clicks a specific radio button. We then have a setNotifications method that adjusts the validation based on
    the selected option. Wouldn't it be nice if we could get rid of this event binding and just watch for changes using
    code in the component class? Let's remove the click event handler from the HTML for both radio buttons here. In the
    component, we already set up a watcher on the notification FormControl that is watching our radio buttons. Instead
    of logging to the console, in the callback function for this watcher we can call the setNotification method, and
    pass in the value. That's all we need to do, let's see if our code still works. Click on Text, and the phone number
    validation kicks in. Click on Email, and the phone number validation turns off. Yep, it works. By using a watcher to
    change the validation, we no longer rely on the HTML to notify us of changes to the input element. Let's see what
    else we can do.</p>

<h3>Reacting: Displaying Validation Messages</h3>

<p>We can do more than just change the validation rules. Let's move our validation error messages out of the HTML and
    into our component class, then use a watcher and react by setting the appropriate message to display. Moving
    validation error messages to the component class gives us much more flexibility, we can read the message text from a
    file, or retrieve it from a back-end server. We can tailor the messages to the user or circumstances, and we can
    greatly reduce the amount of boilerplate code in our HTML. We'll just move the validation messages for one
    FormControl in this demo, but you can use these techniques to move any of your validation messages to the component
    class. We could even make the validation code generic, so one set of code would handle display of all of the
    validation messages for the template. For now, let's just move the validation messages for the email FormControl. We
    start in the component class, and build a data structure to store the validation error messages. We define the
    validation rules as key and value pairs, where the key is the validation rule name, and the value is the string
    message we want to display. We'll hardcode them here, but you can imagine these being populated from an Angular
    service that retrieves them from a file or back-end server. We then define a property that will contain the
    validation message to display. So this structure defines the list of all of the available validation messages for a
    particular FormControl, and this contains the validation message to display to the user, if any. The input element
    in the HTML will bind to this property, and display the validation message as appropriate. Now let's add a watcher
    on the email FormControl. We want to start watching right away, so we add the code to the ngOnInit method. I'll
    paste the code, and we can talk through it. Every time the control is changed, we want to reevaluate the validation
    messages. Why every time? Because adding or deleting a single character could cause the validation status to change,
    requiring a change in the validation error message. First, we define a variable for a reference to the email
    FormControl to minimize repeated code, then we add a watcher for the FormControl. In the watcher's callback function
    we call a setMessage method and pass in the FormControl. This setMessage method will determine the appropriate
    validation message to display, if any. We'll add this new method down here. The method takes in a FormControl or
    FormGroup, so we set the type to AbstractControl. The method does not return anything, so we set the return type to
    void. In the method body, we first clear any current message. Why do we clear the messages first? Because the most
    recent change to the input element could cause all of the validation rules to pass, and we don't want any leftover
    messages showing. Next, we determine whether we should display a validation message. All of the dirty, touched,
    valid checking moves out of the template and into the component class here. We want to display a validation message
    if the associated input element was touched or dirty, and the FormControl has validation errors. We use the
    JavaScript Object.keys method to return an array of the validation error's collection keys. Recall that the errors
    collection uses the validation rule name as the key. Since our validation message's data structure also uses the
    validation rule name as the key, we can directly map into our validationMessage's data structure. That way this can
    handle display of multiple messages, if necessary. In looking at this method, I'm sure you can already see ways to
    make it more generalized to work with other FormControls, but this will do for our purposes. Now for the best part,
    in the HTML we can remove all of the dirty, touched, valid checking, and bind instead to the emailMessage property.
    We start here with the ngClass. If there is a value in the errorMessage property, we set the has-error style, that's
    it. Same for our span here, and we simply display the contents of the emailMessage using interpolation. Wow, that
    simplified our HTML. Let's try it out in the browser. We type a character in the Email input element, and we see the
    pattern error. We delete the character, and we see the required validation error, and if we put in something
    matching the pattern, the error is gone. It works, yay. But there is an issue with this watching technique. When
    using the valueChanges watcher, we don't get notified of focus events, that's because when it gets or sets focus,
    its value doesn't change. This means that we can't use valueChanges to display a message when the input element is
    touched. Another thing that can be irritating for the user is that we are telling them that they made an input error
    before we've even given them a chance to enter a valid email address. As soon as I type a single character here,
    it's telling me that the email address is not valid. Well of course it's not valid, I haven't finished typing it
    yet. To delay validation, giving the user a chance to enter the data, we can use Reactive transformations. Let's see
    what that means.</p>

<h3>Reactive Transformations</h3>

<p>Observables provide operators that allow us to transform how we see the emitted events. There are many observable
    operators that do everything from filtering, to mapping, to throttling, to solving world peace. Well, maybe not that
    last one. One such operator is debounceTime. DebounceTime ignores all events until a specified time has passed
    without another event. For example, debounceTime(1000) waits for 1 second with no events before emitting another
    event. This is very useful for validation, especially if you don't want to show the validation messages until the
    user has stopped typing. Let's look at this with a marble diagram. A marble diagram shows events as marbles on a
    timeline, and is useful for visualizing observables. Without debounceTime when the user starts typing we get
    valueChanges events for every change they make. Since we are setting validation on the valueChanges event, the user
    sees a validation message as soon as they type the first character, we don't give them a chance to enter a correct
    value. We continue to display the validation error messages until the user has typed enough to match the pattern. If
    we use the debounceTime Reactive transformation, we don't receive events until the user has stopped typing the
    defined amount of time. That gives the user a chance to enter a correct value before we start displaying validation
    error messages. In this example, the user types ab@c and pauses. When the specified amount of time passes since the
    last character was typed, we receive the valueChanges event and perform the validation. At this point the value is
    valid and no validation message is displayed. If the user then types more characters and pauses, when the specified
    amount of time again passes, we receive the valueChanges event, and again perform the validation. DebounceTime is
    one of the most commonly used reactive transformation operators when working with validation, but there are many
    others. ThrottleTime emits a value, then ignores subsequent values for a specified amount of time. This is useful
    when you receive way too many events, as when tracking mouse movements. DistinctUntilChanged suppresses duplicate
    consecutive items. This is useful when tracking key events to prevent getting events when only the Ctrl or Shift
    keys are changed. And there are many more, you can see the list of them here. Now let's see a Reactive
    transformation in action with a demo. We are back, and looking at the component class. The first step is to import
    the debounceTime Reactive extension's operator. Next, we call the debounceTime operator on the observable here, and
    specify the desired wait time. We'll wait 1 second, which is 1000 ms. That's it. Now our email validation should not
    display until the user has had a chance to enter a value. Let's see it in action in the browser. Recall previously
    that when we entered a character, we'd see a validation message asking us to enter a properly formatted email
    address. Now we have a chance to type in a valid email address before the validation kicks in. I'll reset the form,
    and type without stopping. Notice that no validation messages appear. Let's try it again, but this time I'll pause,
    and the validation message appears. Such a little change, and such a big difference for our user's satisfaction.
    Let's finish up this module with some checklists we can use when we do our own watching and reacting.</p>

<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>

<p>To watch for changes to a FormControl or FormGroup, use the valueChanges observable property, and subscribe to the
    observable by calling the subscribe method. This provides notifications each time the value of myFormControl
    changes. To react as the user makes changes to a FormControl or FormGroup, we simply write code in the subscribe
    function. Code in the subscribe function can change validation rules. In the demo, we watched the send notifications
    FormControl, and added required validation on the phone number when the user selected to be notified via text. Code
    in the subscribe function can handle validation messages. We saw how to move the validation messages and control the
    error message styling from the component class instead of hardcoded in the HTML. Or we can write code in the
    subscribe function to adjust user interface elements, provide automatic suggestions, and so much more. To use
    Reactive extensions such as debounceTime, we first use the import statement to add the operator, then we use the
    operator by chaining it on the observable. We can chain any number of operators here. In the demo, we saw how to use
    debounceTime to give the user a chance to enter a valid email address before displaying validation messages. In this
    module, we examined how to watch for changes, and react to perform tasks such as modifying validation rules and
    managing validation messages. We also saw how to leverage Reactive transformations, such as debounceTime, to
    transform the events we are watching. At this point, we have successfully moved much of the logic we had in our
    template for the email input element into our component class. On the left is the original HTML for the one input
    element using the template-driven technique. It's long and has lots of styling and validation logic. On the right is
    the HTML as we have it now. It is the same input element using the Reactive forms technique. Notice that we have no
    complex logic here deciding when to display the has-error style class, no two-way binding, no validation attributes,
    no hardcoded validation error messages, or complex logic deciding when to display those messages. We simply set the
    formControlName directive and use the property containing the validation messages to display. Which HTML would you
    rather build, maintain, and test? Up next, let's look at how to dynamically add input elements to our form.</p>
