<h2>Final Words</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As you have seen throughout this course, Angular provides a consistent set of patterns for building components,
  templates, and services, helping us to come to speed quickly. Welcome back to Angular 2: Getting Started from
  Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata and the final words in this course include a recap of our journey, a few
  pointers to additional information, and to look at a broader description of Angular. Let's jump right in to this
  short module. </p>
<h3>Recapping Our Journey</h3>
<p>The goal of this course was to guide you down the right path, making your own adventures with Angular 2 more
  pleasant and productive. Let's recap our journey and review the answers to the key questions we identified at the
  beginning of this course. What is a component? We discovered that a component is a view defined with a
  template. Logic, defined with a class. And metadata, defined with a decorator. Where do we put the HTML for our
  user interface? Either in the metadata, using the template property, or in a separate HTML file using the template
  URL property in the metadata. When should we use binding? Anytime we want to display a component class property
  value in the view. When we want to control the DOM by setting a DOM element, property, and code. When we want to
  respond to user actions, and when we want to display a component class property, and update the property when the
  user makes a change. Why do we need a service? We uncovered several reasons for building a service. To implement
  functionality that is independent from any particular component. To share data and logic across components, and to
  encapsulate external interactions such as with data access. And how, how do we build an Angular application? With
  code that looks like this. Export a class, attach a decorator, and import what we need, then put each component
  directive endpipe in its appropriate Angular module. Along the way, each module provided a set of checklists
  containing steps and tips. Feel free to revisit and reference these checklists as you start building your own
  Angular applications. </p>
<h3>Learning More</h3>
<p>This course covered the basics, but there is so much more. On Pluralsight, the Angular 2: First Look course
  provides a comparison of Angular One to Angular 2 and presents some more full-featured sample application and
  watch for additional Angular 2 courses coming soon to a device near you. The Angular 2 Documentation is very
  comprehensive and growing everyday. It is a great reference to everything Angular. And I've set up a GitHub
  Repository for this course so you can use it as a starting point or learning aid. It provides starter files if you
  want to try building an application yourself or you can review the completed course files here. </p>
<h3>What Is Angular? (Revisited)</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this course, we defined Angular as a JavaScript framework for building client-side
  applications using HTML, CSS and a language such as JavaScript, but this is a somewhat narrow view of Angular
  focusing on using it just for client-side web applications, but Angular is actually so much more. A better
  definition is that Angular is a platform. It supports multiple languages, multiple templating syntaxes, and
  multiple rendering targets. It has features to support mobile web such as material design, a set of widgets that
  work across devices. Angular Universal, to pre-render views on the server and web workers for background
  processing, and Angular supports native mobile development using products such as Ionic and NativeScript. Keep an
  eye on Pluralsight and Angular IO for more information on these exciting technologies. </p>
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Congratulations, you've made it. You've completed the journey through the basics of Angular 2, but the road goes
  ever on and on. There are many more paths for us to take and so much more to learn. Thoughts or comments about
  this course? Please use the discussion tab on the Pluralsight page for the course to leave your feedback. And
  follow me on Twitter. It would be great to hear about your Angular 2 adventures. Thanks for listening <a
