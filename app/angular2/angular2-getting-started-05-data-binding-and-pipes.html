    <h2>Data Binding &amp; Pipes</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>There's more to data binding than just displaying component properties. we want to bind DOM elements to component
      properties so the component can change the look and feel as needed. We can use bindings to change element colors
      or styles based on data values, update font size based on user preferences, or set an image source from a database
      field, and we want notification of user actions and other events from the DOM so the component can respond
      accordingly. For example, we respond to a click on a button to hide or show images. And sometimes, we want the
      best of both worlds using two-way binding to set an element property and receive event notifications of user
      changes to that property. In this module, we'll use Angular's property binding to set HTML-element properties in
      the DOM. We walk through how to handle user events such as a button click with event binding and how to handle a
      user input with two-way binding. Lastly, we'll discover how to transform bound data with pipes. And here once
      again is our application architecture. We have the first cut of our product list component, but it doesn't have
      any interactivity. In this module, we'll use data binding features to add interactivity to the product list
      component. Let's get started.</p>
    <p>Welcome back to Angular Two: Getting Started from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata and in this module, we
      explore more data binding features and transform bound data with pipes. To provide a great interactive user
      experience,</p>
    <h3>Property Binding</h3>
    <p>Property binding allows us to set a property of an element to the value of a template expression. Here, we bind
      the source property of the image element to the image URL property of the product, effectively defining the source
      of the image from information in our component class. Our binding target is always enclosed in square brackets to
      the left of the equals and identifies a property of the element. The binding source is always enclosed in quotes
      to the right of the equals and specifies the template expression. For comparison, here is a similar binding using
      interpolation. Note that in this case, the element property is not enclosed in square brackets and the template
      expression is enclosed in curly braces with no quotes. Like interpolation, property binding is one way from the
      source class property to the target element property. It effectively allows us to control our template's DOM from
      our component class. When we can use property binding or interpolation to achieve the same result, which one is
      better? The general guideline is to prefer property binding over interpolation. However, if you need to include
      the template expression as part of a larger expression such as this example, you may need to use interpolation.
      Now let's add some property binding to our sample application. Here we are back in the editor, looking at the
      product list component and its associated template. Let's use property binding to bind the source of our product
      image. We use an image element to display our product image and we'll use property binding to bind the image's
      source or SRC property so we enclose the SRC in square brackets. On the right side of the equals, we define the
      template expression in quotes. We want to bind to the product's image URL property from the product list component
      class. Let's also use property binding to bind the title property of the image to the product's name. Let's check
      out the result in the browser. Whoa, they're big, but we do see images. If we hover over an image, we see the
      image title, but this image is rather large for display in our table. Let's use property binding to set some style
      properties. Let's add properties for the image width and image margin to our component class. The image width is a
      number so we specify its type with a colon and then number. Let's set it to 50. The image margin is also a number
      and we'll set it two. Back in the template, we use property binding to bind the image styles. We want to bind the
      style property width in pixels. We'll bind that to the image width property from the component class. Notice that
      we don't prefix this property with product because image width is a property of the component class, not the
      product object. And we do the same with the style margin in pixels and set that to the image margin class
      property. So now we've seen how to use property binding to bind several properties of the image element to
      properties of the components class. Looking again at the browser, that looks much better, but our images are
      always displayed. The show image button doesn't work yet. To hook up the button, we need to respond to user
      events. Let's do that next.</p>
    <h3>Handling Events with Event Binding</h3>
    <p>So far, all of our data binding has been one way from the component class property to the element property, but
      there are times we need to send information the other way to respond to user events, for example to perform an
      operation when the user clicks a button. A component listens for user actions using event binding as shown
      here. Notice how similar this syntax is to property binding. In this example, the component listens for the click
      event on a button. The name of the bound event is enclosed in parentheses, identifying it as the target event. To
      the right of the equals is the template statement. This is often the name of a component class method followed by
      open and closing parentheses and enclosed in quotes. If the defined event occurs, the template statement is
      executed calling the specified method in the component. Wondering where you might find a list of valid DOM events?
      Check out this link. The Mozilla Developer Network provides a thorough list of standard events along with some
      documentation. Now let's give event binding a try. In this demo, we want to implement our show image button.
      First, we define a class property that keeps track of whether the images are currently displayed. We'll call that
      property show image. Since this property is true or false, we define its type as Boolean and let's set its default
      value to false so the images are not displayed when the page is first loaded. Next, we build the method that the
      event binding will call. By convention, methods are normally created after all of the properties are defined so
      we'll put it down here. Let's name the method toggle image. Notice that TypeScript does not require any keyword
      such as function. Following the method name with open and closing parentheses identifies it as a method. Our
      method won't have a return type so we specify the return type as void. The body of the method simply toggles the
      state of the show image property. Back in the template, we are ready to set up the event binding. On the button
      element, we define the click as the target event by enclosing it in parentheses. We assign it to our method
      enclosed in quotes. When the user clicks the button, the binding calls our method. So the only thing left is to
      actually hide or show the image. Recall how we add logic to add or remove HTML elements from the DOM? If you said
      the NGF directive, you are right. We'll add NGF to the image element. We only want this image element if the show
      image flag is true. So we type star NGF equals quote show image. The image element will then only be added to the
      DOM if show image is true. Let's see if this works. Are we ready to give it a try? Click the button and the image
      appears. Click the button again and the image disappears. Oh, very cool. The only odd thing is the button text.
      When the image is displayed, the button text should change to hide image. So up here where we have the button
      text, let's use interpolation. When show image is true, we want the button text to say hide image. And when show
      image is false, we want the button text to say show image. We accomplish this using a JavaScript conditional
      operator. We specify the condition which is show image and a question mark. Then we specify the true expression so
      when show image is true, we want to display hide image. Then we add a colon and the false expression so when show
      image is false, we want it to say show image. Basically, we can read this syntax as if show image is true, display
      hide. Otherwise, display show. Let's check this out in the browser. So our button text now says show image. If we
      click it, it says hide image. That seems a little more user friendly, cool. Now that we have our images
      working, let's tackle the filter by box. And for that, we need two-way binding. </p>
    <h3>Handling Input with Two-way Binding</h3>
    <p>When working with user entry HTML elements such as an input element, we often want to display a component class
      property in the template and update that property when the user makes a change. This process requires two-way
      binding. To specify two-way binding in Angular, we use the ngModel directive. We enclose ngModel in square
      brackets to indicate property binding from the class property to the input element and parentheses to indicate
      event binding to send a notification of the user-entered data back to the class property. We assign this directive
      to a template expression. To help us remember which order to put the two sets of brackets, visualize a banana in a
      box. Square brackets for the box on the outside and parentheses for the banana on the inside. So now we have
      another Angular directive that we can use, every time we want to use an Angular directive in a template, we need
      to consider how to make that directive visible to the component associated with that template. Recall that an
      Angular module defines the boundary or context within which the component resolves its directives and
      dependencies. The illustration of our AppModule currently looks like this. We want to use the ngModel directive in
      our product list component which is owned by AppModule. So in the AppModule, we need to import the appropriate
      system module that exposes the ngModel directive. Since the ngModel directive is most often used when building
      data entry forms, ngModel is part of FormsModule so we import that here. Now, the ngModel directive and any of the
      other Angular forms directives are visible to any component declared by AppModule, including our product list
      component. Now let's give this a try. We are back in the editor and looking at the product list component and its
      associated template. Recall that we defined a filter by input box here and display the entered filter here. We'll
      later use the filter to filter our list of products. Let's start by adding a component class property for the list
      filter. This property is a string and we'll set a default initial value for filtering the list of products. We
      hard code the filter string here, but you can imagine that we store the user's last entered filter and use that as
      the default instead. With that, we can set up the two-way binding. On the input element, we draw a banana in a box
      and specify the ngModel directive. We bind to the component class list filter property. We want to display the
      list filter here so we use interpolation. Recall that interpolation has no quotes. Are we done? Not quite. Let's
      see what happens if we try to run. The page doesn't appear. If we press F12, we see the error is can't bind to
      ngModel model since it isn't a known property of input. This is telling us that Angular can't find the ngModel
      directive. Recall from the slides that the ngModel directive is part of the Angular module for forms called
      FormsModule. To expose this directive to our product list component, we need to import the FormsModule in the
      module that owns the product list component which is our AppModule. We start by importing FormsModule from Angular
      forms. We then add FormsModule to the imports array for the NG module decorator. Why the imports array and not the
      declarations? Our directive's components and pipes are declared here in the declarations array. Directives,
      components and pipes we use from other sources, such as Angular itself or third parties, are defined in external
      Angular modules we add to the imports array here. Now that we've told Angular where to find the ngModel, let's see
      the result. When the page displays, we see cart as the default value. It is displayed here and here. If we modify
      the entry, notice that the displayed filter text is also updated. That's because we are using two-way binding.
      Notice that the list of products is not yet filtered. We'll do that in the next module. There is one more thing we
      do want to address now and that is the data formatting. That price should really look like a price and show the
      appropriate currency symbol. </p>
    <h3>Transforming Data with Pipes</h3>
    <p>With Angular's data binding, displaying data is easy. Just bind an element property to a class property and we're
      done. Well, not always. Sometimes the data is not in a format appropriate for display. That's where pipes come in
      handy. Pipes transform bound properties before they are displayed so we can alter the property values to make them
      more user friendly or more local appropriate. Angular provides some built-in pipes for formatting values such as
      date, number, decimal, percent, currency, uppercase, lowercase, and so on. Angular also provides a few pipes for
      working with objects such as the JSON pipe to display the content of an object as a JSON string, which is helpful
      when debugging, and a slice pipe which selects a specific subset of elements from a list. We can also build our
      own custom pipes as we'll see in the next module. Let's start with a simple example. Say we want to display the
      product code in lowercase. We can add the pipe character after the property in the template expression and then
      specify the lowercase pipe. The product code is then transformed into lowercase before it is displayed. We can
      also use pipes and property bindings. Add the pipe after the property in the template expression and specify the
      desired pipe. In this example, we specified the uppercase pipe so the image title will appear in all caps. If
      needed, we can chain pipes. In this example, the price is transformed into a currency. By default, the currency
      pipe adds the all caps three-letter abbreviation of the local currency to the amount. If we want to display that
      abbreviation in lowercase, we can transform it again by simply adding another pipe. Some pipes support
      parameters. Parameters are defined by specifying a colon and a parameter value. For example, a currency pipe has
      three parameters, the desired currency code, a Boolean value indicating whether to display the currency symbol,
      and digit info. The digit info consists of the minimum number of integer digits, the minimum number of fractional
      digits, and the maximum number of fractional digits. The value here of 1.2-2 means at least one digit to the left
      of the decimal and at least two digits to the right of the decimal and no more than two digits to the right of the
      decimal, effectively defining two decimal places. With that, let's jump back to the demo. We specified the pipes
      in the template so we are looking at the product list component template. Let's add a lowercase pipe for the
      product code and a currency pipe for the price. For the product code, we simply insert the pipe character after
      the property in the template expression and type lowercase, that's it. For the price, we insert a pipe character
      and currency. That's all that is required, but let's try out a few of the parameters. We'll specify USD true to
      display the dollar sign instead of the currency abbreviation and 1.2-2 to specify that we want at least one number
      to the left of the decimal place and two and only two numbers to the right of the decimal place. Let's see how we
      did. Looking at the result, we now see the product code in lowercase and the price displayed nicely as a currency.
      So we can easily perform simple data transformations using the built-in pipes in the template expressions for our
      bindings. Feel free to try out some of the other pipes from the slides. Let's finish up this module with some
      diagrams and a checklist we can use as we work with bindings and pipes. </p>
    <h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
    <p>Data binding makes it easy to display class properties from our component and set DOM element properties to our
      class property values to better control the view. And the component can listen for events from the DOM to respond
      as needed for an interactive user experience. There are four basic types of binding in Angular. Here is a diagram
      as a memory aid. Interpolation inserts interpolated strings into the text between HTML elements or assigns element
      properties. Be sure to wrap the template expression in curly braces and no quotes. Property binding sets an
      element's property to the value of a template expression. The binding target specifies a property of the element
      and must be enclosed in square brackets. The binding source specifies the template expression and must be enclosed
      in quotes. Event binding listens for events and executes a template statement when the event occurs. The target
      event specifies an event name and must be enclosed in parentheses. The template statement often defines the name
      of the method to call when the event occurs and must be enclosed in quotes. Two-way binding displays the component
      class property and updates the property when the user makes a change. Use the banana in a box syntax with the
      ngModel directive. The binding source specifies the template expression and must be in enclosed in quotes. Here
      are some things to remember when using ngModel. Define ngModel within the banana in a box for two-way binding. Be
      sure to add FormsModule from the Angular forms package to the imports array of an appropriate Angular module. In
      this case, AppModule. This ensures that the ngModel directive is available to any template defined in a component
      associated with that module. We'll talk more about Angular modules later in this course. The data we have in our
      component may not be in the format we want for display. We can use a pipe and a template to transform that data to
      a more user-friendly format. To use a pipe, specify the pipe character, the name of the pipe and any pipe
      parameters separated with colons. Here is an example of the currency pipe with three parameters. This module
      covered data binding and pipes. We looked at property binding, event binding and two-way binding. Lastly, we
      discovered how to transform bound data to a more user-friendly format using built-in pipes. And here once again is
      our application architecture. In this module, we finished more of the product list component, but it could be
      better. Next up, we'll see several techniques for improving our component.</p>
