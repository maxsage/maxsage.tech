<h2>Routing</h2>

<h3>Introducing Routing</h3>

<p>The storyline tracker has a dashboard, vehicles, characters, and a series of detail views. We need a way to get
from one view to another. Routing is that vehicle. This module is going to show how to configure routing, which
is going to enable us to navigate between our vehicle and character components. So we'll define our routes and
we're going to use a concept called routing modules to hold those routes. Sometimes we need to be able to pass
parameters from one place to the other, we'll learn how we can do that through routing. And sometimes we want to
stop certain routes from happening, those things are called guards inside of Angular. We can inspect the route
at a key moment in time, right before it's about to transition, to either get some data to inject inside of its
destination or to check a certain value, maybe if you're authorized or not, and then prevent the route or let it
continue onward. We'll learn about all these concepts and much more in this chapter on routing.</p>

<h3>Routing Essentials</h3>

<p>Angular allows us to navigate between viewing component pairs with a router. Routing is how we allow the users
to navigate from one point to another. Let's take a look at how routing compares from Angular 1 to Angular 2. In
Angular 1 we used a routeProvider object, which had a when function. In Angular 2 it's a little bit simplified,
we just have a Routes object, and we'll use that to define our configuration for our paths, when I see this URL,
go here. In Angular 1 we had an ng-view element, which is where we would place the destination of the route, so
when that thing that we're going to show, the view in the component, shows up in the screen, the ng-view's be
the placeholder for it. Angular 2, it's now called a router-outlet. Where we used to use ng-href in Angular 1 to
define the link to go to a route, in Angular 2 we have a routerLink directive and we use that with the property
binding, with the square brackets. If we want to access routing parameters, in Angular 1 we use routeParams and
in Angular 2 we use the ActivatedRoute object. And of course we had a router object in Angular 1 and we still
have a Router object in Angular 2. So as you can see, some of the names have changed, but the basic concepts of
routing are still here and there's actually a few new features too, and we'll learn about those as this chapter
progresses. But first, let's talk about the things we need to get started. In our index.html, we want to make
sure that we've got a base href of slash, that base element is really important for routing to work. And there's
five basic steps to routing. The first step is going to be the import the RouterModule, just like we had in
HttpModule and a FormsModule, we have a RouterModule. And we'll pull that into our project and then when we want
to do things with routing, to get that routes object, for example, we're going to go ahead and import from the
ES6 module angular/router. Of course to have routes we need to define that. That's going to be our configuration
that we set up with paths that lead to components. And where does our route go? For that we're going to need to
declare a router-outlet somewhere on our page. Those routes we defined in step 3 are going to have to go
somewhere. They're going to show up in the router-outlet, and if we want to create like a menu somewhere for the
application, a great idea for that would be to use the routerLink bindings. By following these five steps, we
can get routing going pretty quickly.</p>

<h3>Essential Routing Code</h3>

<p>Let's begin by taking a look at the code that we're going to need to get routing moving in our application.
First we'll define a file called app-routing.module. Now that's going to match the app.module file. Effectively
these are the routes for our root of our application and in here we're going to pull in the RouterModule from
the angular/router ES6 module, that's going to give us access to all the routing things that we're going to want
to use. The first of which is the routes object itself. And we'll use that to declare our routes. And how do we
do that? In the same file here, the app-routing.module, we're going to define that list of routes with a path
and then where does that path lead. So we define the path, the first one in this case happens to be blank,
that's the default path, and we're going to tell it to redirect to characters path. So if we go to blank or we
go to characters, we're going to end up at the character-list.component. We can also use a colon to identify
parameters and the key here is notice that all these paths end up leading to a component, that's our
destination. Then we'll define our own module and I'm going to call it app-routing.module because it's for our
app root, and we're going to import in that RouterModule and we're going to use this function called forRoot and
we're going to pass to it the routes that we just configured. So we're using the module that comes out of
Angular and basically injecting those routes into it. And we're wrapping it up into our own class called
AppRoutingModule. This makes it easier for us to use the routing in our own module, such as our AppModule. Be
sure that you only use this forRoot function in the root module's routes though, that's why it's called forRoot.
In our case our root module is the AppModule. Well let's look at the stuff we just did. We have our list of
routes, these are our paths, and we configure them all up, now they're inside of this routes variable. Then we
use the route to make an NgModule. We pass those routes in to the RouterModule.forRoot and we're really paying
attention to this AppRoutingModule we create. Now as a convenience I like to actually export the component list
that I'm going to use and I'm going to have to declare it in my main module, it just makes it easier so I have
less of those ES6 import statements in all my files. Now after I'm done with this file I'm going to be exporting
two things, the AppRoutingModule and my routable components and then something else, as you might have guessed,
is going to import those. That's going to be our app root module. So we're going to define this routing module
and then import it in the that app root module. We could also do it into a feature module and we'll learn more
about that in the next chapter. But for now, we're going to have one module still, the app root. So how does
that look? In our app.module.ts I have my standard stuff as always and I also have this import statement up top
that's going to import in my AppRoutingModule that I just created and my routable components, then I'm going to
pass the AppRoutingModule as a parameter to the imports array. This gives my app module, my application if you
will, access to the routing features that Angular provides and the routes that I have configured. And notice
that I have routable components in here in the declarations. Remember we have to declare any component we use,
this was just a nice easy way to pass them along to give to the app module. If I didn't export those in the
previous file, I'd have to reimport them and then list them in the declarations one by one. So this was just a
convenience feature. Once we have the code set up we want to work on how we put routing in our templates. First
we might want some kind of a menu, so let's say in app.component.html we've got this navigation section and we
can set up these routerLink directives. We'll use data binding with them and one will go to characters and one
will go to vehicles. That routerLink is going to help us navigate to the path and then we'll pas to it the link
parameters and those link parameters are an array which contain the different parameters for the different
route. In this case, the route that I'm going to is going to be called /vehicle and that gets matched against
the path. When somebody clicks on one of these hyperlinks here, it's going to activate the router link and then
it'll go and look for the router-outlet and that's going to define where I put my components. Now that we've
learned how to do routing, let's go take a look at it in our sample applications.</p>

<h3>Adding the Routing Module to an App</h3>

<p>Let's take a look at our sample applications, we'll slide on down to number 25, Router. This is going to show us
how routing application works. We're going to build this in just a moment. So here in our app we've got a list
of characters and a list of vehicles. If I click on vehicles I can see them and characters and I can also click
on an individual character and go look at details. All the different components are already in my application.
Now let's close those two samples and we'll click on the Needs Router, number 24. We'll open that sample up.
This one doesn't have any routing in it yet, but it has the same components, as we can see here. Let's close
down the preview so we can type for a little while, and let's go add a new file. We mentioned that we have to
add in this new file earlier called app-routing.module. So I'll add that alongside the app module. Now let's
click inside of here, we'll start by importing NgModule because we're going to create our own NgModule for the
routing and that comes out of Angular Core, just like we've done before. And we'll pull in the routing features.
So I'll import Routes and RouterModule. That's going to give us access to those different features. Now let's go
ahead and create a constant called routes and we'll define it of type Routes object and that's going to be an
array. This is where we're going to put our own custom routes. Each one of these is going to take an object,
we're going to give it a path. Now let's think about it like this, the path is when you see blank, what do you
want? Well I want to make sure their path matching everything because in a blank it could be, anything could
start with a blank, right? So we're going to do full. So it's going to have to match that exactly and then
redirectTo in this case a new route. I really don't want to name a route that's called blank, so instead I'm
just going to make the blank route, basically the slash for my application, go somewhere else. I'm going to make
it go to a route called characters. Perfect. So the next one that would make sense to create is the path for
characters, otherwise we're not going to be redirecting anywhere, are we? And when it gets there, we're going to
say go ahead and find a component called CharacterListComponent. Now I just told it to go to a place that I
haven't imported yet. So now I have to go import that CharacterListComponent. So I'll import that guy and I have
to know where to get it from. Well in our application it's in the characters folder and it's right here. So
let's go ahead and type that in, we'll do ./ to do a relative path, it's under
characters/character-list.component. Make sure we got the name matched up and we are good to go. Now we have a
few more paths we want. We also want to go to vehicles, so we'll copy and paste this one here and we'll say
alright make the path vehicles, and this time we'll call it VehicleListComponent, and then up here we'll copy
and paste and we'll go get the VehicleListComponent out of that folder. Now our vehicles also has a parameter
for vehicle, which is a vehicle detail page right here, so we could get that one in there as well if you'd like
to. We'll go ahead and add it for now. We'll copy the vehicles again and this time we want to say when you go to
vehicles/id, don't go to VehicleListComponent, but go to the VehicleComponent. So yet again we're going to go
create another import up top and this time it's going to get the VehicleComponent. Perfect. Now that we have our
routes, let's create our NgModule. So we're going to export a class and it's going to be called
AppRoutingModule. Why did I pick that name? Well I picked that name because it is the name of the file, but also
because I have an app module right here. So this is the app module's AppRoutingModule. And I'm going to decorate
that class with my NgModule, like this. And inside of there, one of the properties is imports and the other one
is exports. Now we want to import the RouterModule, that gives us the features for the routing that Angular
provides and we want to tell it go ahead and use the routes that we just defined right here. And we also want to
export to expose the routing features to whoever imports it. In this case the guy who's going to import this
AppRoutingModule is right over here, we want him to be able to access the RouterModule. So we have our exported
class and next, so I don't have to copy these three import statements here and then also declare them in the app
module, instead I'm going to create an export of a constant here called routableComponents, this is just a
convention that I like to use. We could, by all means, just copy and paste those, and then I'm going to say okay
put the CharacterListComponent here, the VehicleListComponent, and then the VehicleComponent. Great. We now have
an AppRoutingModule. Now let's go over to our app module, we're going to need to import that file, so let's come
down to the bottom of this import list and we need to pull in the things that we just exported from the other
file. Well those are going to be the AppRoutingModule, that was the one we defined, and then the
routablecomponents, and we have to tell it where to get those from, and that's going to be a relative path, it's
going to be our app-routing.module. Once we have those, we need to import this AppRoutingModule into the
NgModule down here. So I'm going to put that last in my list. If you'd like we can separate these out, make them
a little bit more readable. It makes it longer, but a little bit more readable. And then where does this
routableComponents go? Well those are just other components that we could use in our application. Now right now
we've already imported CharacterList, VehicleList and VehicleComponent, I'm going to delete those and do this
instead. Yes I could have left them there, but look what I can do up top now. I no longer need to import that
line, this line or that line. Those three components up top were part of the routing, so I don't need to import
them in two different files. It just kind of cleans up my code a little bit. Okay, now my app module is pulling
in the AppRoutingModule, it's declaring the routable components, so all those components are there, and then
it's going into my AppRoutingModule and defining these different routes, all that gets set up with what we just
did. Let's take this opportunity to look over our code. We did a lot of stuff here, we're importing NgModule
from Angular Core and Routes and RouterModule, well they actually come from angular/router, so we should type
that in here at the end of line 2. That was a typo I had. And now let's make sure we've got the CharacterList,
VehicleList and VehicleComponent in the right files. I have a tendency, as you've noticed, to type in vehcile,
so that's actually vehicle right here. The important part is to make sure it matches up with whatever you put
your paths. So those three components are going to be used for the destinations of the route. And then we have
our four routes, the default route, which will go to characters, and then vehicles and vehicles/id. And we have
the CharacterList, VehicleList, and VehicleComponent, those three different paths. Next up, we create our
AppRoutingModule class and we import in the router module and its routes and we export the router and then we
created a simple array of routable components that we're exporting. Back inside of app module, we import the
AppRoutingModule and the routable components on line 11. We no longer needed the declarations to be imported for
those components, instead we just imported the routable components and used it on line 21. We defined the import
for the AppRoutingModule on line 17 and our app module is good to go. If you're typing along with me, go ahead
and take this moment to catch up and then we'll move on to how we get them into the templates.</p>

<h3>Adding Routing to Templates</h3>

<p>Now that we've added the routing code to our app, let's have a place for it to show up inside of our templates.
Go ahead and open up the app.component.html and in this section right here we're going to add a router-outlet,
just like this, and that'll be where our templates are shown when we route to them. Well how do we route to
them? Let's add some navigation for that. We'll create a nav tag and inside of there a ul, and then we'll create
one li first with an a and then inside of the anchor tag we will create a routerLink directive right there, and
we're going to do data binding on this, so we learned earlier that we use that with these square brackets, then
a double quote here and inside of the double quote is going to be an array and inside of that array the first
element is going to be the path we want to match it to. So this will be characters. So make sure you've got all
your quotes in the right places, we've got a quote around the value, which is an array, and that array has a
string of /characters, and that's got to match what we have back in our routing module for characters, for the
redirectTo and the path from line 10. We're also going to need one for our vehicles in a moment. But first
inside the a they have to have something to click on, so we'll make the menu item say characters. We'll then
copy and paste it because that never gets us in trouble, right? And then we'll type in vehicles for the second
path and Vehicles for the title. And then once we do that, we should be good. We can now just click on the
preview and if everything worked out okay we should see our data shows up and both of our menu items. If I click
on vehicles, we go to the vehicles, if I click on characters we go to characters. If you were coding along with
me and it worked out, awesome. And if it didn't, you feel free to go back and try again or if you'd like you can
go off and click on the Router number 25 example in our main demo app, it's the conclusion of what we just did.</p>

<h3>Sending and Receiving Route Parameters</h3>

<p>Now that we know the routing fundamentals, let's take a look at how we can define parameters. Inside of our
routing module we already set up one parameter for the character ID. This is how we define a parameter, we use
colon and then the value. Now once we set up that parameter, it's going to be interpreted by the router to say,
okay if I see character/ then a value, it's going to mean go to this path and it'll go to that particular
character component. But how do we pull the data back out once we get there? Well there's a couple of ways that
we can get data to another component. One is by using the snapshot. This is the easiest as long as the parameter
values aren't going to change. It's one line of code and it makes it easy to pull that value out in the
destination component. Another option is to use an observable. This will get new parameter values whenever the
component is reused, for example, let's say you had a character detail component and on there you wanted to
navigate to another character detail component, well then you're actually activating the same component again.
So you'd want a way to make sure that you can get that new value, the observable will be able to stream in the
new values for you. It's a little bit more code, but it's a little more flexible. So snapshot is great if you're
not going to go like detail to detail, because the parameters aren't going to change, the next you come into the
detail component you'll probably go back out to a list, select it, and then come back in. But if you're going to
go from detail to detail, the observable is really key. And there's also a third way, it's called using
resolver. This is a way we can pass data to a route before the component is actually loaded. Let's explore these
three. In the destination component, let's say it's a SessionComponent where we want to pull out the id that was
pulled in as a parameter. We first inject the activated route. This is an object we can inject that's set up by
pulling in that router module. We don't have to provide this particular one because this service comes with the
router module. Once we have that, we can use that route object to go into the snapshot property and look for the
parameter named id. As I said, this is the easiest way to get them. As long as that id isn't going to change
while you're on the component, you're good. If the id is going to change, because we're going to go from a
detail component to another detail, we could use observables, or if you just want to be safe. Here we go to the
route.params because that's an observable, so we'll map the response. Now that parameter comes across as a
string, so now I'm using the do to say, alright take that id, do a parseInt on it and put it into a number, this
id. Now I've got it locally in my class and I can subscribe to any of the changes. So whenever these values
change, if the id parameter does change, I'll be able to get it and it will go get the correct session for it.
So we just learned how we can grab parameters using the snapshot technique or getting a string with them by
using observables. Let's go take a look at our demo apps to see how that works.</p>

<h3>Subscribing to Route Parameters</h3>

<p>Let's go back to our demo application and click on the Router Completed example, and we'll take a look at where
we have parameters in our application. When we click on vehicles we can see we've got the Millennium Falcon and
then we click on that and we see the details for that Falcon. If we go back to vehicles, we click on X-Wing
Fighter, we can see those details. Well let's look inside the vehicles folder and here on the vehicle component
we're receiving a parameter. Notice on line 17 we're injecting the activated route, that activated route is how
we're going to access the parameters. Notice line 26 inside of the ngOnInit is going to say alright look at that
route, look at its parameters, and then we're going to map those parameter's id, and this is just a shortcut way
to make it turn into a number, and then we're going to subscribe and when we get this value, when this comes
through this pipeline, that stream, we're going to subscribe to it and then run getVehicle. And down on line 35
it'll call the getVehicle, passing in the id to the service and it'll come back out the other end and we set our
vehicle locally. And the parameter name on line 28, id, has to match what we have in our routing module, right
here on line 15, vehicles/:id. And that's how we set up routing parameters in our application.</p>

<h3>Basics of Route Resolvers</h3>

<p>Earlier we talked about a third way to pass data to a route, that third technique is using a resolver. Resolvers
are a way to get data prior to navigating to the route. Let's take a look at how we define one of these
resolvers. These are key for the scenarios where you want to get data before you actually go to the particular
component. In this case my resolver is just a service and it's going to implement the resolve interface, which
comes from the angular/router ES module. That interface says we must implement the resolve function and one of
the parameters there is the route, which is the activated route snapshot. That will allow us to grab information
about the parameters before actually going to the destination. And we can use that to call an existing service,
like the Vehicle service to go get the vehicle and when it comes back, if it has a vehicle we can return it, if
not we can create a new instance of it. We probably want to have some kind of error handling here as well
because what if things go wrong? In that case, we'll head back to the vehicles list, or we could put an error
message up for the user, it's really up to us. But here's our chance to inspect things in the midst of a routing
action. Once we have this service, we can go ahead and implement it and apply it to the route. So inside of our
route we add a resolve down here as a property of that route, so we had path and component, we take the resolve
and now we specify the data values we want. They'll be an object called vehicle that we resolve to. So we define
this inter route configuration and remember, if we're going to create a service called VehicleResolver, we still
have to provide it somewhere, because that's how the dependency injection finds it. And we can define more than
one of these if we want to. We could have a VehicleResolver and maybe another resolver too. Most often one is
enough. And then the way you get that resolver data back inside of your component is to then take that activated
route and then look at that data value. So we're going to subscribe to that and then we can grab the vehicle
that we decided we wanted to pass in, that vehicle property is the one we defined in the route configuration and
it's of type vehicle. Let's go take a look at our application and see where we can use resolver.</p>

<h3>Route Resolver in the Storyline Tracker</h3>

<p>The storyline tracker has several different routes in it. One of them is a vehicle-routing.module, and here we
can see a path for parameter for id is going to go to a VehicleComponent and on line 23 through 25 we can see a
resolver for the vehicle. This means that when they go to that id for the vehicle, we're going to go down to
this vehicle.component and it's going to receive that value. So if we look inside of here for the ngOnInit,
which is on line 67, we can scroll on down beyond the comments, which is explaining the resolver here, and we
can see that we're getting the route and then it's data property and we're subscribing to it, and in there we're
getting that data object with the vehicle. And then once we get that, we can then perform any local logic we
need to do, like setting the local vehicle variable or grabbing the vehicle's id. Up above we can see some other
ways we could have grabbed the values. If I wanted to pass a parameter we could have done so. For example, we
could have used the snapshot, right here on line 73. That would have allowed us to pass the parameter, the
difference between passing the parameter and the resolver is the parameter would have gotten to this page, it
would have shown the page, and then we'd have to go get the data, so then the spinner that we could show up on
the page would show up on the destination page while waiting for the data. The same thing with using the second
technique here with the ActivatedRoute where we go ahead and use an observable and we subscribe to that to get
the parameter value, we'd have to then go get the data as shown here on line 81. So when we use parameters, we
have to go get the data after we get to the destination. With a resolver, we're waiting before we actually
traverse to the destination. So it really depends what your user experience needs to be. If you want to get the
data before you go on the route use a resolver, if you want to use it after, use a parameter.</p>

<h3>Route Guards</h3>

<p>When a user goes to our vehicles page or our characters page, maybe we want to check first to see if they've
been logged into the system. For that we might want to block or at least inspect that route or guard it. That's
where routing guards come into play. They allow us to make decisions at certain key points in that routing
lifecycle and then we can either continue, we can abort that action or do something different. When we're at
that moment where a user can navigate anywhere in an app at any time, that's not always the right thing that we
want to do. Maybe the user isn't authorized, maybe they can't navigate to the target component because of that.
Maybe the user must log in first. Maybe we need to fetch some data before we display it, like with using
resolver. That's one type of guard, but there's other types too. For example, maybe we want to save some pending
changes before we leave a component or at least ask the user if it's okay. Let's explore some of those different
types of router guards. We've already learned about the resolve, we'll use that to pass some data into a target
component. Another kind of a guard is a CanActivate guard. This one is one we can use to say do we want to go to
that particular component. For example, we want to go to /characters, well before we do that maybe we want to
make sure that they've been authenticated first. So we can use the CanActivate guard to check to see if
authentication has occurred. If it has, let them continue. If not, we block them and maybe show an error message
or reroute them to a login page. Like CanActivate, we also have a CanActivateChild. This is for child routes,
which we'll talk about very soon. And maybe we're on a particular component, but we don't want the person to
leave until that they've answered a question. For example, they might be editing a character, and maybe in the
middle of editing that character, they try to leave. Well if the state is dirty, we can implement a CanDeactive
guard to check that state and then ask the user, do you want to save these changes, cancel them, or what do you
want to do? And then there's the CanLoad guard. This one's similar to the CanActivate where we get an
opportunity to inspect some information, to check to see, for example, are you authenticated before you go to
the destination, but unlike the CanActivate, the CanLoad will not even go get the contents, the HTML and the
JavaScript, for that module that you're going to until it's been satisfied. This is really ideal for things when
you do lazy loading, which we'll look at more in the next chapter. For now, we'll concentrate more on the other
guards. Let's take a look at how we implement a CanActivate guard. Often we'll use this for an auth guard for
authentication. Have you been authenticated yet? We'll implement the interface for CanActivate, which means all
the function called CanActivate with the ActivatedRouteSnapshot and a RouterStateSnapshot, and then we'll either
return true or false to let them either proceed with the route or to get out. Notice in this logic here, if the
person isn't logged in, we're going to route them to the login page and then return false. So we're going to
cancel the current route and introduce a new one. This allows us to really change the way the application
behaves. Once we define the guard, we have to apply it. Here we've got a dashboard route and we're applying the
CanActivate with the AuthGuard. Notice that it's an array that's because we could apply more than one guard if
we wanted to. Now that we've learned about using routing guards, let's go check out an example in our demos.</p>

<h3>Applying Route Guards</h3>

<p>We'll go on down to number 26, Route Guards, and we'll click on View Sample. Here we're going to have two routes
for vehicles and for characters once again, but now we've got a login as well, so we can authenticate. Notice
the default route is characters and it's showing the login page. That's because we have a guard in place saying
hey you're not authorized so we're redirecting the login. However, vehicles is allowing us free reign to come
in, it's not guarded. And then of course we can go straight to login. The behavior we want is if you click on
characters it should take you to login, but remember you wanted to go to characters, so after we login, which
we're just delaying and doing a quick fake login, here we're going to then go back to the characters route.
Let's take a look at how this guard is implemented on the characters and let's also apply it to vehicles. Now
our routing is inside of the app-routing.module, we'll open that up, and notice that we have a route for
characters and for vehicles. On the characters we're using CanActivate and CanActivateChild and we're putting
the same AuthGuard on both of them. The guard for CanActivate on line 22 is making sure that if you go through
characters, the main page, that it's going to guard it. The CanActivateChild is guarding the child pages. So if
we try to do a deep link to one of those, it would guard one of them. But we're not guarding the vehicles at
all. So one way we can handle the vehicles is just to put the guard on it. Let's go ahead and copy CanActivate
right there on line 22 and let's put it inside of the vehicles, just like that. Now nobody can get to the
vehicles directly. However, they can still get the vehicle's id. So we could put that guard here as well. Here's
a case for why we might want to use child routes as well. Notice in the characters we have the characters route
as the path of characters and then we set up two children. The first one goes to the blank path, which is
CharacterList and the second one to an id for the CharacterComponent. By breaking this out into child routes, we
can now take advantage of the CanActivateChild to guard all of the children. Because we didn't do that with the
vehicles, we have to go ahead and make sure we're guarding the CanActivate for both specific routes. So if we
had multiple child routes, this is really helpful in implementing the guards. We could just do a
CanActivateChild. Well let's test this out real quick. If we press run, now when the app loads, again it's
trying to go to characters so we try to log in, I can't go to vehicles either, I'm clicking on that, it's not
happening. Once I log in though it goes right to the vehicles page and I can go back and forth between the two
different places until I log back out again. Now how did this guard get applied? The guard is called
CanActivateAuthGuard, it's really just a service, right. Well our AppModule down here happens to have a
providers list and one of those happens to be our guard. So make sure that you provide your guards as well.</p>

<h3>Child Routes</h3>

<p>We just saw how we can guard different routes and got a sneak peek at child routes. Child routes are a great way
to create hierarchical sets of routes. We took at look at some routing we had with characters and child routes.
We defiend the URLs for those parent routes and then for the child. They get put together to create the end
route. So above here that first path is characters and the second one would be character/72 if that happened to
be the id. Let's step back and take a look at how this could look in an application. We might have a root route
for our app and that might redirect to the dashboard route. So we could have one route for dashboard. We might
have another one for vehicles and a third for characters. Well in what we just defined for those routes we could
have characters/ and /id for 21 maybe, for a different character id for a list and a detail page. Those could be
child routes for characters. And then vehicles could do the same thing. We saw this in the previous example and
it was a very subtle, but important reminder in that last demo. Do you notice where we provided that guard that
we showed? We did that in the module providers, that was our CanActivateAuthGuard. We did it in the root
injector and the reason for this is if we're going to have a guard, it cannot be provided at a component level
or a level lower than where it's going to be used. These guards are being used by the routing before they
actually get to the component. So they had to be put into a provider of something a little bit higher level.
Most often these guards will make sense in the root injector. Don't worry though, if we put it in the wrong
place and Angular can't find our provider, it will give us that message of cannot find provider for
CanActivateAuthGuard and that's a good hint that maybe you don't have it in the providers at all or it's not in
the right level. In that case, just push it up to the root injector. Let's take a look at all the things we've
learned about routing in the storyline tracker. The storyline tracker has a dashboard, characters, and vehicles.
It's also got an admin area, but if we click on there, it's got that guard in there. This is where we've got the
CanAuthGuard, which is on the CanActivate of the admin, which kind of makes sense in a real app, right. You
don't want to get to an admin page unless you have permissions. Maybe you want to not let anybody get into
anything until they have permission as well. So you can really manipulate how you want these guards to work. And
then once I log in, I can then say okay you're good, go back to the admin page and do great things, and then you
can go anywhere you want in the app. There's different kinds of guards too. We mentioned that we can have a
CanDeactivate, so let's go inside of BB8 and let's change BB8 from the light side to the dark side. And before I
press Save, let's just go back to the dashboard. When I try that it's saying, wait a minute - do you want to
cancel your changes? Why do you think it asks us if we want to cancel the changes? Exactly, because there's a
CanDeactivate guard on this route. Well let's hit Cancel and it's going to stay right here. If I hit the
dashboard again and I go to OK, it's going to cancel the changes on me and go back to the dashboard. Now if I go
back to the characters and BB8, he's still on the light side. Let's take a look at how this is implemented. Now
where might this me in the code? Let's think about this. We have a characters route, so let's go check out the
characters themselves, there's actually a routing module in there and we're going to learn more about how you
can create nested routing modules in the next chapter, but for now we can see down here that on the characters
child route we have an id on line 19 and then a CanDeactivateGuard on line 21. Perfect. I'll bet you there's the
same kind of guard on the vehicles too. Let's go over to vehicles, we'll try the Millennium Flacon and we'll
change this from space to land and then we'll click on characters and the same kind of question comes up. As you
can see, guards can be extremely helpful for implementing different kinds of logic. I recommend that you tinker
with the guards for this application to get a feel for how they can work in different scenarios.</p>

<h3>What's Next with Routing</h3>

<p>This chapter we learned quite a bit about routes. We started with the basics and then we showed how we can
define different kinds of routes, then we defined the routing module, which encapsulates all that information
about our routes. We learned how to define route parameters and pass information along to the target component,
and then extract that using snapshots or using an observable. And remember, the pros of the snapshot are it's
easier, but with the observable you're always guaranteed to get the updated parameter information. And then from
there we learned how we can use resolvers to make sure we get data before we actually go to the destination of
the route. That was one kind of guard. Can you name any others? Yeah, there was the CanActivate, which we used
to make sure we could go to a particular route. Often you see that with authentication scenarios. And then we
saw a CanDeactivateGuard, which prevented the user from leaving the screen until they met certain criteria, like
making sure they didn't leave the screen in a dirty state, and they either saved their changes or cancelled
them. And to make it easier to apply guards we actually set up child routes, which helped us create a hierarchy
of the routes. In the next module we'll continue exploring routes, but in the context of modules, ngModules.
When we combine these two features together we can do things like eager loading and lazy loading of modules, and
we can even apply guards so we can only load the content of a lazy loaded module when we want it. We'll learn
how to do that and much more with ngModules in the next section.</p>
