<h2>First Things First</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>First things first. Before we can start coding with Angular 2, there are some preparatory steps. Welcome back to
    Angular 2, Getting Started from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module, we set up what we
    need to work with Angular 2. A little preparation goes a long way towards a successful adventure. Before we take
    that first step on our journey with Angular 2, we need to make some decisions, gather our tools, and get
    everything ready. In this module, we evaluate several languages we could use to build an Angular 2 application,
    and select one. Once we've picked a language, we select an editor that fully supports development in that
    language. Then, we set up the boilerplate code for an Angular 2 application. Then, we talk about modules and what
    they mean in Angular 2. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Selecting a Language</h3>
<p>When building Angular 2 applications, we have many language choices available to us. First, some background. The
    JavaScript language specification standard is officially called ECMAScript, or ES. Up until recently, the ES
    versions were defined by a sequential number. ES 3 is supported by older browsers. ES 5 is the version currently
    supported by most modern browsers. The ES 6 specification was recently approved and renamed ES 2015. Most browsers
    don't yet support ES 2015. So, ES 2015 code must first be transpiled to ES 5. What does that mean? Code developed
    with ES 2015 must be compiled by a tool that converts the ES 2015 syntax to comparable ES 5 syntax, before the
    browser executes it. That way, we as developers get the benefits of the new ES 2015 productivity features, and the
    browsers still get code they understand. Since Angular is a JavaScript library, we could use any of the many
    compiled of JaveScript languages to build our Angular 2 application. But, the most common language choices for
    Angular 2 include, the ES 5 version of JavaScript. ES 5 code runs in the browser today without transpilation, so
    no compile step is required. If we wanted to take advantage of some of the new ES 2015 features to improve our
    productivity, such as classes, the let statement, and arrow syntax, we can write our Angular 2 code using ES 2015.
    We then transpile our code to ES 5 before running it. Another language option is TypeScript. TypeScript is a
    superset of JavaScript, and must be transpiled. One of the key benefits of TypeScript is its strong typing,
    meaning that everything has a data type. Because of this strong typing, TypeScript has great tooling, including
    inline documentation, syntax checking, code navigation, and advanced refactorings. So, TypeScript helps us better
    reason about our code. The Angular team itself takes advantage of these benefits and uses TypeScript to build
    Angular 2. Most of the demo code in the Angular documentation at present also uses TypeScript. For these reasons,
    TypeScript is the language of choice for many Angular 2 developers, and is the language we use in this
    course. Dart is another option. It is a non-JavaScript-based language for building Angular 2 applications. Because
    we'll use TypeScript throughout this course, let's take a moment to look at what TypeScript is all about.
    TypeScript is an open source language that is a superset of JavaScript and compiles to plain JavaScript through
    transpilation. It is strongly typed, so every variable, every function, and every function parameter can have a
    data type. How does TypeScript determine the appropriate types when using JavaScript libraries that are not
    strongly typed? By using TypeScript type definition files. These files contain the definition of each type in a
    library. These files are named with the library name .d.ts. TypeScript implements the ES 2015 class-based
    object-orientation, plus more. It implements classes, interfaces, and inheritance. So if you have experience with
    object-oriented programming language, such as C#, C++, or Java, using TypeScript may feel very natural to you.
    This course does not require any prior knowledge of TypeScript. I'll cover what you need as you need it. But if
    you want to learn more about TypeScript, check out the TypeScript Playground. This website allows you to do live
    coding with TypeScript, see the transpiled JavaScript, and run the result, all without installing anything. There
    are also several TypeScript courses in the Pluralsight Library, including TypeScript Fundamentals, Angular with
    TypeScript, which walks through using TypeScript with Angular 1, and Using ES6 with TypeScript, which details all
    of the new ES 2015 features, such as let and arrow syntax. Again, you do not have to know TypeScript for this
    course. We'll learn it as we go. Now that we've selected TypeScript as our Angular 2 language, let's pick an
    appropriate code editor. </p>

<h3>Selecting an Editor</h3>
<p>There are many editors that fully support TypeScript, either out of the box or with a plugin, including all of
    these. Select one of these, or whichever editor suits you best, but keep in mind, that your experience with
    TypeScript will be much more pleasurable if you select an editor that understands TypeScript. For this course, I
    am using Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code runs on Linux, Windows, and OS X. It has great features that
    support TypeScript, such as Auto Completion and Telesense syntax checking and refactoring. If you wanted to use VS
    Code as your editor, you can download and install it from this URL. If you are interested in using Visual Studio
    Code and want to learn more, check out their website or this Pluralsight course. But, you are free to use
    whichever editor you choose. Now that we've picked a language and selected and installed an editor, let's set up
    our environment.
</p>
<h3>Setting up Our Environment</h3>
<p>Setting up our development environment for Angular requires two basic steps, install npm or Node Package
    Manager, and set up the Angular 2 application. There's no need to manually install Angular or TypeScript or any
    other library. However, this step two is really quite a process. But, first thing's first, what is npm? Npm, or
    Node Package Manager, is a command line utility that interacts with the repository of open source projects. Npm
    has become the Package Manager for JavaScript. Using npm, we can install libraries, packages, and applications,
    along with their dependencies. We'll need npm to install all of the libraries for Angular, and to execute scripts
    to transpile our code and launch our Angular 2 application. If you don't already have npm, you can download it
    from this link. Let's take a look. Here is the npm website. To install npm, scroll down to Getting Started. You
    click here. That takes us to the Download page for Node. Angular suggests npm version three or better, so click
    Current to get the latest features. Then, select the installer appropriate for your OS and Install Node, which
    installs npm. Feel free to pause the video and install npm now if you don't already have it. Okay, with npm
    installed, we are ready to set up our Angular 2 application.
</p>
<h3>Setting up an Angular 2 Application</h3>
<p>Setting up an Angular 2 application can be somewhat laborious. Before we begin, let's list the required steps.
    Then, we'll look at ways we can set up Angular without actually performing all of these steps. But to manually set
    up an Angular 2 application, we'd need to create an application folder add package definition and configuration
    files, install the packages, create the application's Root Angular Module, because every application needs at
    least one Angular Module, then create the main.ts file to load that Angular Module, and create the host web page,
    normally index.html. Luckily, we have some options. We can manually perform each of these steps. The detailed
    instructions for each step are provided in the Angular documentation at Angular IO. Or, we can simply download the
    result of these quick start steps from Github. Alternatively, we could use tooling, such as AngularCli. AngularCli
    is a command line tool for generating the setup files and boilerplate code for an Angular 2 application, including
    scaffolding the unit and end-to-end tests. The AngularCli can be found here. We'll look more at the Cli when we
    visit Setup later in this course. To keep the grunt work for our sample application to a minimum, I've prepared
    another option, starter files. I've created the initial files we need for our Angular 2 application. These files
    are available in my Github repository. In addition to the basic setup files for an Angular 2 application, the
    starter files include extra files we need as we build our sample application. So, let's go with this option. I've
    navigated to my Github repository following the URL from the slide. If you are comfortable with Git, you can clone
    this repository. Otherwise, click this button to download all of the files as a single ZIP file. The APM-Final
    folder contains the completed code for our sample application. Use these files if you want to see the end result.
    The AMP-Start folder contains the starter files. These are the files we will use as the starting point for
    building our Angular 2 application. After downloading the files, copy or extract the files in the APM-Start folder
    to a working directory called just APM. Your APM folder should then look like this. Now, let's open the APM folder
    with a code editor. I've opened the APM working folder in my selected editor, VS Code. First, let's talk about the
    directory structure. By convention, all of the files specific for our application are under a folder called app.
    We only have a few folders and files here now, but we'll add more as we progress through this course. For
    applications for any size, we'll have subfolders under the app folder for each major feature in the
    application. These are the setup files. To get us going quickly, we won't dive into these files now. We'll learn
    what these files, what they contain, and what they do in the Angular 2 Setup Revisited Module later in this
    course. So, the last thing we need to do is install all of the libraries required to develop and run our
    application. Open a Command Prompt or terminal. Be sure it is set to the root folder for the application, which
    should be the working directory we named APM. Type npm install. This installs all of the libraries we
    need, including the libraries to run the application, such as Angular, and for development, such as TypeScript.
    Note that you may see warnings and errors during this installation process, like these. In most cases, you can
    ignore them. If you see something like this tree structure at the end, the install completed successfully. Note
    that you may see different version numbers than what I have here. If it ended with an error, try running npm
    install a second time. That often completes the installation. Going back to the editor, notice that we now have a
    node_modules folder here. This is where npm installed all of our libraries, and we have a typings folder where it
    installed the TypeScript definition file we needed. We talk more about TypeScript definition files in the Angular
    2 Setup Revisited Module. Now that we have everything installed, let's try running the sample application.
</p>
<h3>Running an Angular 2 Application</h3>
<p>To get us started, I've included enough additional code with a set of files to run the sample application. So,
    let's give it a try. Back at the command prompt, or terminal, type npm start. The start script starts a file
    server to launch our application called lite-server, an it runs the TypeScript Compiler called tsc in Watch Mode.
    The TypeScript Compiler and the file server watch for any code changes. So anytime we save a change to any of our
    files, TypeScript recompiles them and the file server refreshes the browser automatically so we can immediately
    see our changes. We'll try that out in a moment. If all is well, the application appears in the browser and
    displays some text, as shown here. If you get errors, ensure that you ran npm install as defined in the prior
    clip. As you can see, our application doesn't look like much, but we'll fix that on our journey through Angular 2.
    Looking back at our code, notice that we now have a .js file and a .map, or a MAP file, for each of our .ts
    files. The start script started the TypeScript Compiler, which transpiled all of our TypeScript files, or our .ts
    files, to ES 5 JavaScript that the browser can understand. The MAP file is a source map that is generated by the
    compiler to debug TypeScript code. I've moved the videos around so that we could see the editor, the browser, and
    the command prompt, or terminal window. Let's see what happens when we make a code change. Any editor will open
    the index.html file. We'll scroll down to the bottom, and we'll make a change. We immediately see here that our
    watchers saw the file change, our code is recompiled, the browser refreshes, and we see our updated text. So
    anytime we make a change to our application, we'll be able to immediately see the effect of the change. You may
    have noticed that I actually didn't save the change. When using VS Code, we can set it to automatically save our
    changes. Here under File, Preferences, Workspace Settings, I have a setting in place to automatically save after a
    short delay. When we are finished working with the browser, we can close it, but the Compiler and file server keep
    running. To stop them, press Control C, and Y, then you can exit. Use npm start anytime you want to run the
    application and keep it running to watch the effect of your code changes. Before we go any further, let's take a
    moment and talk about modules.</p>

<h3>About Modules</h3>
<p>With JavaScript, there is always the problem of namespaces. If we are not careful, we can easily end up with
    variables or functions in the global namespace. In addition, JavaScript didn't provide features to help with code
    organization. Modules help resolve these issues. Angular 1 has modules to help us organize our code and resolve
    some namespacing issues. TypeScript also has modules that help keep things out of the global namespace. ES 2015
    set a standard for defining a module. In ES 2015, a module is a file, and a file is a module. So when coding in ES
    2015, we don't need to define or name modules. Just create a file, write some code, export or import something,
    and bang, the file becomes a module. Angular 2, leverages ES 2015 modules. So as we could code files and import or
    export something, we create the modules for our application. But wait, there's more. Angular 2 also has Angular
    Modules. Angular Modules are separate and different from Angular's implementation of ES 2015 Modules. Let's look
    at how Angular 2 makes use of ES 2015 Modules. Then, we'll introduce Angular Modules. How do ES 2015 Modules
    work? Say we create a code file called product.ts, and export a class named Product from that file. This file then
    becomes a module. Because the class is exported, we can use that class in any other module by importing it. So
    here, we have a file called product-list.ts, and we import our Product class. This file also becomes a module
    because we imported something. Notice the syntax here. In curly braces, we find the name we want to import, in
    this case, Product, and we define the file we want to import it from. Here, we want to import from product.js.
    Wait, what? The Product class is in product.ts. But when we compile, the TypeScript file is transpiled into an ES
    5 JavaScript file. So at runtime, we are importing from the .js file. But, notice that we don't list the extension
    here anyway. We'll see why in a moment. Now, let's look at Angular Modules. Angular Modules help organizing an
    application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Every Angular application has at least one Angular Module, by
    convention called At Module. As an application gets more features, we can group those features into their own
    feature modules. We can even define shared or common modules for code used by multiple Angular Modules. This keeps
    the code organized and provides a cohesive unit we can unit we can load on start, or lazy load as needed. In each
    Angular Module, we declare the set of components and other code files associated with the module, and the
    dependencies needed by those components. Each component we create is declared in and belongs to one, and only one,
    Angular Module. We'll talk much more about Angular Modules throughout this course. Let's clarify the difference
    between ES 2015 Modules and Angular Modules. ES Modules are code files that import or export something. Angular
    Modules are code files that organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. ES Modules organize
    our code files. Angular Modules organize our application. ES Modules modularize our code. Angular Modules
    modularize our application. ES Modules promote code reuse. Angular Modules promote boundaries within our
    application. So, ES Modules are about code files, and Angular Modules are about our application. To keep these
    terms straight, I'll refer to the ES 2015 as ES Modules and Angular Modules as Angular Modules. With that, we are
    ready to look at how we load our ES Modules and host our application.
</p>

<h3>Loading ES Modules and Hosting Our Application</h3>
<p>When a user accesses our web application, the first file that is downloaded to them is the index.html file. It is
    in this file that we define our link and script tags, set up our Module Loader, host our application, and display
    our first view. We can think of it as the entry point for our application. Let's look at it. In the index.html
    file, we have link tags to define our stylesheets, and script tags to load up the libraries we need. I cover what
    these files are in the Angular 2 Setup Revisited Module later in this course. The next part of the index.html
    file, configure system .js for loading library, third-party, or our own modules. In other words, it loads all of
    our code files for us, so we don't need to add script tags for each file we add to the application. Here, we pull
    in the script file that configures systemjs for our application. This line of code starts our application by
    loading the ES 2015 Module that's in the path app. Recall from the prior clip that an ES 2015 Module is just a
    code file that imports or exports something. How does systemjs know which file in the app path to load? It's
    defined in the systemjs.config file. Here at the bottom, we find app, and see that the main entry point is
    main.js. So, systemjs loads and runs the module named main that is located in the app folder. We'll look at that
    main module in the next course module. And we see that the default extension for all modules loaded from the app
    folder is .js. This is why we don't have to specify the extension when importing modules. We'll talk more about
    this configuration file in the Angular 2 Setup Revisited Module of this course. Going back to the index.html file,
    here is the body of our HTML page. It is here that we host our Angular 2 application. We'll cover hosting in the
    next course module. With that, we have everything we need in place to build our first Angular 2 application. Since
    we won't be referring to Angular 1 again, from this point forward, I'll often refer to Angular 2 just as
    Angular.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this module, we discussed several languages and selected TypeScript.TypeScript has all of the productivity
    features of ES 2015, plus strong typing for better tooling. We then selected an editor. Which editor you use for
    TypeScript is a personal preference. For the best experience, be sure your selected editor fully supports
    TypeScript. We then installed npm and looked at the laborious process required to manually set up the boilerplate
    code for an Angular 2 application. Instead of manually setting this up, we downloaded the starter files from my
    Github repository. We then saw how to install, run, and edit the sample application. We covered ES Modules and how
    TypeScript uses ES Module syntax to export and import functionality from our ES Modules. We introduced Angular
    Modules and how they organize our application and promote application boundaries. And, we saw how to configure the
    ES Module Loader. Recall the architecture for the sample application we are building that we outlined in the first
    module? So far, we only have the index.html file defined. In the next module, we'll start writing some Angular 2
    code and build the app component shown here.
