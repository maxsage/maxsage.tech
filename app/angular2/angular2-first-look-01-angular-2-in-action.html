<h2>Angular 2 in Action</h2>
<h3>Angular</h3>
<p>Angular 1 applications have spread like wild fire on the web, establishing Angular as a core framework in many
    company's toolbox. As the web evolved, so did Angular - into Angular 2. It's a full and modern web framework
    that enables us to create powerful applications. This course provides a developer's first look at Angular 2.
    We'll learn its benefits, understand the role of its features, and how to build Angular 2 apps. Hi, I'm John
    Papa, and I'm excited to welcome you to Pluralsight's Angular 2: First Look course. This course is a first look,
    which makes it an ideal starting place for us to see the over arching view of the core concepts in Angular 2 and
    how to write apps with it. We'll learn how our Angular 1 skills translate and prepare us to build Angular 2
    apps. The smoothest way to see the value in Angular 2 is to jump right in. To that end, we'll be coding in the
    Plunker online editor, this will streamline our learning experience by enabling us to run all samples live on
    the web where we can see and edit them with a click of a button, no setup required. ES5, ES2015, TypeScript, we
    have plenty of options. While we can write Angular 2 in a variety languages we had to choose one, so we'll use
    TypeScript. If you want to learn more about TypeScript, check out the TypeScript Fundamentals course that Dan
    Wahlin and I co-authored here on Pluralsight. Before beginning this course you should be comfortable with the
    basics of JavaScript, while familiarity with Angular 1 and TypeScript will be helpful, they're certainly not
    required. But let's start by asking, why Angular 2? I mean, who will I be if I learn and use Angular 2? The
    answer to that question lies in understanding Angular 2's value to companies and developers. Well, it's fast,
    much faster than Angular 1 as it relies on modern web standards and practices. It's powerful, Angular 2 is a
    full framework that covers the common use cases we all encounter. And we write clean code with Angular 2. There
    are less Angular constructs, for one example, Angular 2's templating syntax alone removes the need for dozens of
    features from Angular 1. Instead, you write HTML and pure JavaScript or TypeScript. And my favorite is writing
    Angular 2 is easy. The concept count is way less in Angular 2 than it was in Angular 1 and the code you write is
    far more intuitive. We often don't have the luxury of picking which browser our customers will use, that'd be
    great, some of us have to support a variety of browsers and versions. We're happy to know that Angular 2
    supports all of these browsers, even IE back to version 9. Angular 2 is already being used internally by Google
    for a massively large app that makes a lot of money for them, you may have heard of it, AdWords. So what can we
    build with Angular 2? This course covers the core concepts of Angular 2, including components, shared services,
    navigation between views, dependency injection, data management, and user and system events. But now let's take
    a look at the app that we're going to use to learn Angular 2.</p>

<h3>What Can We Build?</h3>

<p>We all love a good story, but it can be difficult to keep track of characters and their experiences. The
    demonstration vehicle for this course will be a storyline tracker, which is a simple application to manage
    fictional characters and their vehicles. This course will be presented in chapters where each will shine a light
    on the core concepts in Angular 2, for example, routing between different pages so we can navigate, drilling
    into detail pages so we can edit, the new template syntax and data binding, how to modularize your application
    by using components, how to share different functionality by using services, and we'll be demonstrating how
    features have either changed from Angular 1 or they're entirely new. There are over 2 dozen samples in this
    course, all showing how they contribute to building the storyline tracker application.

<h3>Running the Samples</h3>
<p>An important part of the learning experience is working with the sample code, all the samples will be able to
    run live on the web, so you can code along and run all the samples with me. There's zero setup required, you
    just need a browser and internet access. You can even download the samples right from Plunker, just go to this
    URL here and you'll be presented with this screen. Here you can see all the samples that we'll be running for
    Angular 2. There's even a couple in here for Angular 1 to show us the comparison between how a controller looked
    in Angular 1 and how it looks as a component in Angular 2. Just find the sample you want, they're numbered and
    they're titled with descriptions, and click on the sample. For example, an Angular 2 component, we can click on
    the sample over here and it opens it up in a Plunker window. Then we can navigate to the files on the left,
    change the code right here and see it run on the right, and because all the samples run online, as Angular 2
    evolves, we'll be updating all these examples so you get the latest code. The same samples are also included for
    download in this course for Pluralsight Plus subscribers. Okay, but what do we do beyond our first look? This
    course is indeed a first look. I recommend that you follow the QuickStart and the tutorial on the angular.io doc
    site. The QuickStart will always be up-to-date with the latest things that you need to get started with Angular
    2. And after you take this First Look course, keep your eye out for the Getting Started with Angular 2 and the
    Angular 2 Fundamentals courses on Pluralsight.</p>
