<h2>Navigation and Routing Additional Techniques</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Now that we know the basics of routing, we are ready for more. Welcome back to Angular 2, Getting Started from
  Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module, we look at several additional routing techniques. With
  what we learned in the prior module, a user can now navigate to any defined route in our application. But that
  only covered the very basic routing scenarios. What if we need to pass parameters to a route? Or activate a route
  with code, instead of with a clickable element? Or what if we need to protect a route, and only allow access to it
  in special cases or by certain users? Or ask a user to save changes before leaving a route? In this second module
  on routing, we examine how to pass parameters to a route, how to activate a route with code, and how to protect
  our routes with guards. When we're finished with this module, we'll know how to handle additional routing
  scenarios, including routing to a component that requires parameters, such as our product detail component. Let's
  get started.</p>
<h3>Passing Parameters to a Route</h3>
<p>We sometimes need to pass parameters to a route. For example, to navigate to the product detail view, we need to
  define which product's details to display. The first step to passing parameters to a route is to configure the
  route with parameters. We've already done this step to route to our product detail component. Here, we define a
  slash, a colon, and a placeholder for the parameter. If multiple parameters are needed, we'd repeat this with
  another slash, colon, and placeholder. With the route definition in place, we can decide where we want the user to
  activate this route. Will we add a menu option or a data link? It is there we set the router link and pass in the
  required parameter. In the product list component template, we display a table of products. Each table row
  contains the product name. We'll add an anchor tag to the product name that activates the product detail route,
  and displays that product's data. So we add a router link to this anchor tag, and assign it to the link parameters
  array. The first element to the array is the string path of the route. The second element of the array is the
  value for the route parameter. When the router composes the URL, it uses this array element to construct the
  defined parameter. To display the appropriate product, the product detail component reads this parameter from the
  URL. It then uses the parameter to retrieve the appropriate product and display it in the view. To get the
  parameter from the URL, we use the activated route service, provided by the router. We want an instance of the
  service, so we define it as a dependency in our constructor. We've seen this syntax before. This line of code
  defines a private variable called _route, and it assigns it to the instance of the activated route provided by the
  angular service injector. Then we use the instance of the activated route service to get the desired parameter.
  There are two different ways to get the parameter. We could use a snapshot, or we could use an observable. Use the
  snapshot approach if you only need to get the initial value of the parameter. The code is then a one liner as
  shown here. In our example, the user is always returned to the list page before navigating to another product, so
  the snapshot approach would be sufficient. If you expect the parameter to change without leaving the page, use an
  observable. For example, if we had a next button on the product detail page to display the next product, the URL
  will change to the next product's ID, so you'd want to use an observable instead. We use the activated route
  snapshot method here, and access the appropriate parameter from its parameter array. The string specified here
  must match the name of the parameter from the path. Let's give this a try. We already have the product detail
  components route configured with a parameter. Looking at that route, here in the path, we provide any parameters
  prefixed with a colon and separated by slashes. For the product detail component, we pass a product ID, so the
  view knows which product's detail to display. Next, we need to decide where to tie this route to a user action. We
  can't add the product detail to the menu, because we don't have an easy way for the user to specify the ID of the
  desired product. Let's instead modify the list of products in the product list view, such that each product name
  is a link, then the user can click on the product to display its details. In the product list template, we'll add
  an anchor tag so the product name becomes a link. We add the router link directive to the anchor tag, and set up
  the link parameters array. In the array, we define the path of the route to activate the first element, and pass
  the parameter value in the second element. In this example, we want to pass the product's ID. When we view the
  result in the browser, we see that the product names are now links. And if we click a link, we see the ID and the
  URL, and we navigate to the product detail component. Yay! But that component does not yet get the parameter from
  the URL. Let's do that next. We add code in the product detail component to get the parameter passed in on the
  URL. We use the activated route service provided by the router to help us. First, we import the service. We don't
  have to register this service, because it is registered as part of the router module, we add it to the imports
  array in the last course module. We then set activated route as a dependency by defining it as a parameter to the
  constructor function. The activated route instance is then injected into this component class. Now, let's get the
  ID from the route and store it in a local variable. We'll use the snapshot approach here, because we don't expect
  the URL to change. Where do we put the code to read the parameter? We don't want it in the constructor. We'll
  instead use the OnInit life cycle hook. Recall from earlier in this course how to use a life cycle hook? We start
  by importing OnInet from Angular core. Then we implement OnInet and write the code for the ngOnInit method. We
  start by routing the parameter into a variable. We use let here, which is new in ES2015, and defines a block
  scoped variable. We then use this._route.snapshot to get the parameter. We pass in the name of the parameter we
  want to read. The parameter name we defined in the route configuration is ID, so that's the parameter name we
  specify here. And because the parameter is provided as a string, we'll add a plus here at the beginning. The plus
  is a Javascript shortcut to convert the parameter string to a numeric ID. To make it easy to see the ID we got
  from the URL, let's display it as part of the page title. Here, we use the ES2015 back text to define a template
  string and display the ID. Let's see the result in the browser. Click the menu option to display the product list,
  then click a product. The URL changes to include the parameter and the product detail page is displayed. If
  everything worked, the title displays the same parameter as shown in the URL, yay! To get back to the product
  list, we could use the menu option here, but it would be nicer to have a back button. Let's add a back button and
  see how to activate a route with code.</p>

<h3>Activating a Route with Code</h3>
<p>We want to add a back button to our product detail page that navigates back to the product list page. We could
  activate this route using the router link directive in the component template, just like we did with the menu
  options. But it's also possible to route with code. So let's try that out instead. When would you want to navigate
  with code instead of the router link directive in a template? One example is a save button, where you need to
  execute some code to save the data, and then route. To route with code, we use the router service. We import the
  router service from angular router. We define a dependency on the router service using a constructor
  parameter. The router instance is then injected into this component class. Every time we inject a service
  dependency into a class, we should ask ourselves, hmm, did we register this service with the angular injector? In
  the case of router, it is registered in router module, which we've added to our application's angular module
  imports array. We use this router instance to activate a route. Here, we define a method that we can call from the
  template based on a user action. The code uses the navigate method of the router service, and passes in the same
  link parameter array we use when binding the router link. In this example, we route to the product's route and
  don't pass any arguments. Let's give this a try. Here we are looking at the product detail component. We want the
  product detail component to navigate back to the product list component. We start by importing the router service
  from angular router. Next we define the dependency by adding another constructor parameter. When this component
  class is constructed, we'll get an instance of both the activated route service and the router service. Now we can
  build a method that navigates with code. Since the purpose of this method is to navigate back, we'll call it
  onBack. It doesn't return anything, so we'll set its return type to void. In this method, we use the this._router
  instance, and call the navigate method. We pass it a link parameters array. In this example, we want to navigate
  back to the product list component, and we don't need any parameters. We just define the route path, which is
  products. In the product detail template, we'll add a button. We again use the twitter bootstrap style classes to
  give the button some style. We use event binding to bind the click event of the button to the onBack method we
  defined in the class. Now let's check it out in the browser. Click on the menu option to display the product list,
  then click on a product. The product detail page is displayed. We click our back button, and we are back on the
  product list page. Let's try another one. We see the detail page, now we're back on the product list page. Our
  code-based navigation is working. So routing with code involves importing the router and using its navigate method
  to activate the route. Now that we have several routes in place, let's look at how to protect them with
  guards. </p>
<h3>Protecting Routes with Guards</h3>
<p>There may be times that we want to limit access to a route. We want routes only accessible to specific users,
  such as an administrator, for example. Or we want the user to confirm a navigation operation, such as asking
  whether to save before navigating away from an edit page.>For that, we use guards. The angular router provides
  several guards, including CanActivate to guard navigation to a route, CanDeactivate, to guard navigation away from
  the current route, Resolve, to prefetch data before activating a route, and CanLoad, to prevent asynchronous
  routing. In this clip, we work through how to implement the CanActivate guard. You can use the same techniques
  we're covering here to implement any other type of route guard. We'll build a guard that prevents navigation to
  the product detail route, unless a specific condition is true. Building a guard clause follows the common pattern
  used throughout Angular. Create a class, add a decorator, and import what we need. Here, we define a
  ProductDetailGuard class. Since we are implementing this guard as a service, we use the injectable decorator, and
  we import what we need. This class implements CanActivate. To create one of the other kinds of guards, change this
  to implement one of the other guard types. We then implement the canActivate method. For simple cases, this method
  can return a boolean value, true to activate the route, and false to cancel the route activation. For more complex
  cases, we could return an observable or a promise from this method. Because the guard class is a service, we need
  to register the service provider with angular's injector. Unlike other services, however, the guard service
  provider must be provided at the angular module level. By providing this service at the module level, the router
  can use these services during the navigation process. So in this example, we register it in our app module, by
  adding it to the providers array. Using a guard is simple. We built the guard to protect the product detail route,
  so we add the guard to the product detail route. We add canActivate and set it to an array containing the guards
  to execute before this route is activated. In our case, there is only one, our product detail guard. Let's give
  this a try. We want to build a guard that prevents navigation to the product detail component, of the provided URL
  parameter is not valid, Recall that the route definition for the product detail component includes an ID. But
  there is nothing here that defines that this ID has to be numeric or greater than zero. So our guard should
  prevent navigation to the product detail route if the ID is zero or not a number. We begin by creating a new file
  for the guard service. Since this guard is only for the product detail route, we'll add it to the products
  folder. We'll select new file and name it product-guard.service.ts. As always, we start with the class. Since this
  particular guard should be checked before activating the product detail route, we implement canActivate. So we
  need the import for that. The router guards are imported from angular router. Since this is a service, we'll add
  the injectable decorator, and the import for that. Next, we need to implement the canActivate method. And we'll
  return a simple boolean. What do we want this method to do? We need to check the route URL and ensure that the ID
  passed in is valid. Luckily for us, canActivate has a parameter that gives us the activated route snapshot. The
  activated route snapshot contains the information about the route at any particular moment in time. Now I'll paste
  the code for the method body, and we can talk through it. The product detail route URL is comprised of two
  segments. Product and the requested ID. We only care about the ID, so we pull the path from the second element,
  which is index of one. The plus here at the beginning converts the URL path string to a number. If the resulting
  value is not a number, or less than one, we display an alert, direct the user to the product list page, and return
  false to abort the current operation. Notice that this code is the same code we used to activate a route with code
  that we saw in the last clip. And as we saw in the last clip, to use the router, we need to inject it in to the
  constructor, and add it to the imports. Here, we return false to abort the current navigation. And here, we return
  true to continue activating the route. Now, we don't normally want to display an alert from our application. In a
  real application, we'd route to an error page that would notify the user of the problem, and optionally provide a
  button for navigating back to the product list page. But this is good enough for our purposes. Because this class
  is a service, we need to register the service with angular's injector. As we discussed on the slides, the guard's
  service provider must be provided at the angular module level. We'll start by importing our product guard service.
  We don't have a providers array defined for our app module yet, so let's add one. Then add the product detail
  guard to the providers array. Now the router can use this service during the navigation process. Next, we need to
  hook up this guard to the appropriate route. We add the canActivate property to the route definition for the
  product detail component, and set it to an array. In the array we specify each guard we want to execute when
  activating the product detail route. In this case, we have only one. That should do it, let's give it a try. If we
  view the product list page, and select a product, our URL is valid and we navigate to the page. If we instead type
  in a URL that is not a number, we see our message. The product detail route navigation is cancelled, and we are
  redirected to the product list page. It works. Use route guards anytime you want to prevent access to a route,
  confirm navigation away from a route, or preload data for a route. So let's finish up this module with some
  checklists. </p>
<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
<p>We can pass any number of parameters to a route, separated by slashes. Add the parameter to the route
  configuration path by specifying a slash, a colon, and the parameter name. Pass the parameter value by adding it
  to an element of the link parameters array>bound to the router link directive. Read the parameter value in the
  navigated component using the activated route service. Notice here that the parameter name, ID in this example, is
  exactly the same as in the route definition. To activate a route with code, use the router service. Be sure to
  import the service and define it as a dependency on the constructor. Create a method that calls the navigate
  method of the router service instance, and pass in the link parameters array. Add a user interface element and use
  event binding to call the created method. We can use guards to prevent access to a route, confirm navigation away
  from a route, or to preload data for a route. To create a router guard, we build a guard service, implement the
  guard type, in our case, CanActivate, and create the associated method. We then register the guard service
  provider which must be registered in a module, not a component. Lastly, we add the guard to the desired route. In
  this module, we covered some additional routing techniques including passing parameters to a route, activating a
  route with code, and protecting routes with guards. We now have routing to our product detail component, yay!
  However, the product detail component and its associated template are not finished. We only wired up the bare
  minimum to demonstrate routing. As a homework assignment, try building the remainder of the product detail
  template and code. To check your answer, you can find the completed application on my GitHub, as described in the
  First Things First module. There you will also find a version of the product data service that retrieves one
  product by ID. You'll need that to get the data for the product detail component. There is one important thing in
  the product detail template that I wanted to draw your attention to. Here is the completed product detail
  component template. Notice this ngIf here. When this page is loaded, it retrieves the selected product, and
  displays the product data. However, since the data access is asynchronous, there is a good change that the page
  will display before the data is retrieved. When that happens, the product property is not set, and the page
  generates binding errors. Adding this ngIf prevents that problem. Keep this ngIf trick in mind if you decide to
  tackle the homework assignment, and when binding to retrieve data in your own Angular applications. At this point,
  our appModule is looking a little cluttered and hard to manage. Up next, let's spend some more time with Angular
  modules and look at how to refactor our application into more manageable pieces. </p>
