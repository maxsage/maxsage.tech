<h2>Dynamically Duplicate Input Elements</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A user often wants to order multiple items on an order form, or enter multiple email, or postal addresses on a
    profile form, or specify multiple expenses on an expense form. Welcome back to Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from
    Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module we learn how to dynamically duplicate input elements on a
    form. Sometimes a single entry is not enough, the user may need to enter multiple values, such as multiple email
    addresses, or in this example, multiple address blocks. Hmm, how do we duplicate these input elements using a
    Reactive forms approach? In this module, we outline the steps involved with dynamically duplicating input elements.
    Then we walk through how to perform each step. Along the way we learn about FormArrays and how to use them. The
    result is a form that duplicates form elements for multiple user entries. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<p>Let's outline the steps here, and then work through each step. To dynamically duplicate input elements, we first
    define the input element, or set of input elements that we want to duplicate. If we allow multiple email addresses,
    then duplicating one input element may be enough, but if we provide for multiple address blocks, there will be a set
    of input elements to duplicate, one for each part of the address. To keep it simple, we'll want to duplicate just
    one thing, if there is one input element, we'll duplicate its FormControl. If there are multiple input elements,
    we'll put their FormControls in a nested FormGroup, so we can use that group as the one thing to duplicate. Then we
    refactor the FormBuilder code to create the FormControl, or a nested FormGroup instance within a method of the
    component class. Next, we create a FormArray to retain those multiple copies. We have not yet talked about
    FormArrays, we'll cover them in detail in this module. In the HTML, we loop through the FormArray and display the
    appropriate input elements for each FormControl or FormGroup in the FormArray. All of these steps are preparation
    for this final step, to actually duplicate the input elements. That's our process, let's jump right in to the first
    step.</p>

<h3>Define the Input Element(s) to Duplicate</h3>

<p>The first step on our path to dynamically duplicating form elements is to define which element or elements we wish to
    duplicate. On a form such as this, the Marketing Department may want to collect multiple email addresses, if so we
    could duplicate this single email input element, but in our case, the Marketing Department requests multiple postal
    addresses so the user could requests catalogs at their home, work, and vacation home, because who wouldn't want
    that? To accomplish this requirement we'll duplicate this entire address block. Note that our user interface uses
    the US address block format, feel free to change it as appropriate for your use. Let's set up our demo accordingly.
    Since the last time we saw the demo application, I've uncommented the address block input elements we commented out
    earlier in this course. I've removed the template-driven form syntax, such as the ngModel directives, and I replaced
    the name attributes with the formControlName directives. I also changed the ngIf here to use the customerForm's get
    method to find the value of the send catalog checkbox. Be sure to specify value here. If the value is true, the
    address block is displayed. In the component class, we add FormControls for each address block input element to our
    form model using the FormBuilder. We'll start with the address type radio button, we'll call it addressType, and set
    its default value to home. Then we'll add the street address 1. Feel free to add validation if desired, we won't
    here just to keep things simple for this demo. Next is street address 2, then city, state, and zip code. Be sure the
    names here exactly match the names used in the formControlName directives in the HTML, they are case sensitive. Now
    let's view it in the browser. By default Send me your catalog is checked so the address block appears. If you don't
    see the address block, check the developer tools for any syntax errors. Be sure that you've removed every ngModel
    directive, changed the name to formControlName, and set the ngIf syntax appropriately. If we uncheck the checkbox,
    the address block disappears, so it's working. Since we need to duplicate this entire address block, let's define a
    FormGroup to encapsulate these address block FormControls, we'll do that next.</p>

<h3>Define a FormGroup</h3>

<p>Our requirement for the demo form is to allow the user to enter multiple postal addresses. To meet this requirement
    we defined the address block as the set of input elements we want to duplicate, and we've added the FormControls for
    these input elements to our form model using FormBuilder. To make things easier, we'll put the set of FormControls
    we wish to duplicate into a nested FormGroup. That is our next step. As we've seen before in this course, a
    FormGroup is simply a set of form building blocks that we can work with as a group. A FormGroup can contain any
    number of FormControls and nested FormGroups. There are several benefits of defining a FormGroup. We can match the
    value of the form model to a data model that contains hierarchal data. We can easily check the touched, dirty, and
    validation state of a group of elements. We can watch for changes to a group of elements and react as needed. We can
    perform cross-field validation, comparing the values of the elements in the group. And, we can dynamically duplicate
    the elements in the group. Now let's define a nested FormGroup for the address block, so we can duplicate its
    elements. We'll start in the component class. Let's modify the FormBuilder to encapsulate the address block
    FormControls into a FormGroup. We'll call the FormGroup addresses and set its value by calling this.fb.group, we
    then copy in the address block FormControls, and we're done. The address block is now in its own nested FormGroup.
    That takes care of the form model, next we update the HTML to put a div element around the associated input
    elements. Let's collapse the address block input elements to make this a bit easier. We open this new div below the
    div with the ngIf, and close it after the zip code, then reformat. We add the formGroupName directive to the div and
    set it to the name of the nested FormGroup. We should be able to run as before, and all is well. If we scroll down,
    we now see the nested addresses FormGroup in the Value property here. We are ready to move on to the next step, and
    refactor so we can make multiple instances of our FormGroup.</p>

<h3>Refactor</h3>

<p>We now have a FormGroup that encapsulates the input elements we want to duplicate. Next, we need to refactor the
    FormBuilder code to create the instance of the FormGroup within a method of the component class. To refactor, we
    define a function and return the address block's FormGroup from this function. Every time we call this function
    we'll get another instance of the address block's FormGroup, then in the FormBuilder code we simply call this
    function, this makes our initial instance of the address block. Let's give this a try. In the component class, we
    add a method. We can name it anything, such as buildAddress, its return type is a FormGroup. In this method, we
    return the FormGroup for our address block, we can copy it from here, and paste it here. We call this method anytime
    we want to create an instance of the FormGroup, then we replace the FormBuilder code with a call to the
    buildAddresses method. By calling buildAddresses here, we create the first instance of our address block FormGroup,
    and add it to our form model. When we view the application in the browser, it should work as before, and it does. We
    are now ready to put our FormGroup into a FormArray.</p>

<h3>Create a FormArray</h3>

<p>In the last step, we refactored our code to create an instance of our address block FormGroup in a method. We can
    call that method to create multiple instances of that FormGroup, but we need somewhere to hold these multiple
    instances. That's the purpose of a FormArray. A FormArray is simply a group of FormControls or FormGroups that are
    conceptualized as an array. Unlike a FormGroup, they are accessed by index instead of by name. A FormArray can
    contain any number of FormControls or FormGroups, but they are often used for like items, such as multiple instances
    of the same FormControl or FormGroup. Because each item in a FormArray does not need a unique name, they are great
    for sets that are dynamic, or of unknown length. It's a perfect choice for storing the instances of our FormGroup.
    Just like the other Reactive forms building blocks, there are two basic ways to create a FormArray. We can use the
    new keyword and create a new instance of a FormArray, passing in an array of FormControls and FormGroups. Or we can
    use the FormBuilder's array method and pass in an array of FormControls and FormGroups. Both ways work. Since we are
    already using the FormBuilder to define our FormControls and FormGroups, we'll use FormBuilders for our FormArray as
    well. Let's try it out. We start by adding FormArray to the import statement, so we can use FormArray as a type.
    Let's look again at the definition of our form model. Notice here that we are creating one instance of our address
    FormGroup. If we are going to allow the user to enter multiple addresses, we need to define a FormArray here
    instead, to hold them all. We use the FormBuilder array method, just as we saw in the slide. And for our particular
    demo form, we want the array to initially contain one instance of our address block FormGroup, so we call the
    buildAddresses method here to create the first instance of our FormGroup, and assign it as the first element of the
    array. So now our first address block FormGroup is an element 0 of the FormArray. To make it easier to access this
    FormArray, let's create a property for it in the component code. To ensure none of the code accidentally modifies
    this FormArray, let's define it as a getter instead of a normal property. I'll paste the code, and then we can walk
    through it. This is the standard syntax for a property getter, since it is returning the addresses we call it
    addresses as well. We define the property as a function, this getter returns a FormArray. We use the
    customerForm.get method to get the reference to the FormArray and return it. Notice that we use a cast operator here
    to cast it to the desired type, otherwise the type is an AbstractControl. Before we can try this out, we need to
    modify the HTML, we need to let it know that our FormGroup is now in a FormArray. We do this by adding another div
    element around our FormGroup, then we'll reformat for clarity. In this div element we use the formArrayName
    directive and assign it to our FormArray's name, which is addresses. Looking back at our form model, we no longer
    have a FormGroup named addresses, rather our FormGroup is in position 0 of the FormArray. So in the HTML, we change
    the FormGroup name to 0, odd looking I know, this will look better in a few moments, but we want to get the code her
    runnable so we can try it out. When we check it out in the browser, it still runs. And notice the Value shown below
    the form, the addresses are now an array as indicated by the square brackets. The array has one array element, our
    FormGroup. Next up, let's loop through that FormArray to create copies of the input elements in the HTML.</p>

<h3>Loop Through the FormArray</h3>

<p>We now have our FormArray set up and are definitely getting closer to duplicating our input elements. Our next step
    is to loop through the FormArray in our HTML, that way if we have multiple instances of our FormGroup in the
    FormArray, we'll display each of them in the HTML. As you may have guessed, looping in the HTML requires use of the
    ngFor directive. Here, we look through each address block FormGroup within our addresses FormArray. The extra code
    here is to gain access to the indexer, we use that indexer as the name of the FormGroup within the FormArray. Let's
    try this out. We want to repeat our entire address block for each FormGroup instance in the FormArray, so we add the
    ngFor to the FormArray div element, using the syntax shown on the slide. This will repeat all of the form elements
    here. Now we can change our hardcoded 0 to the variable i, and since this is bound to a variable we need to surround
    the directive with square brackets. Each FormGroup in the HTML now has a unique name that is the index of the
    FormGroup in the FormArray. There's one more thing to consider here. Now that we will have multiple copies of these
    input elements, we need to ensure that each label is associated with the correct input element. To do that, we can
    use the i variable in the id attribute of the input element. I'll change it for the first street address here. Then
    we need to change the labels for attribute, however we can't bind to the for attribute directly because it has no
    associated dom property. Instead we use attribute binding, like this, and we change the id to match the id here. By
    using the index number in the id and in the label's for attribute, when we have multiple address blocks a screen
    reader will associate the correct label with the correct copy of the input box. When we view the results in the
    browser, the form and the Value look the same. That's because even though we are looping we still only have one
    FormGroup instance in the FormArray. Next, let's add what we need to actually duplicate our input elements.</p>

<h3>Duplicate the Input Elements</h3>

<p>We're almost there. We now have all of the support pieces in place, and we are ready to create more instances of our
    FormGroup, and duplicate its associated input elements. This step requires that we add a method that creates another
    instance of the FormGroup or FormControl, and pushes it onto the FormArray. And we need some way for the user to
    request a copy of the input elements, so we add a button in the HTML. We use event binding to bind the new element
    to our new method. When the user clicks the button, the method is called, adding another FormGroup instance to the
    FormArray. Let's give this a try. We'll start by creating the method we need. We call it addAddress, which returns
    void. Recall that we defined a getter that returned the reference to our FormArray called addresses. In this method
    we simply push a new instance of the FormGroup onto our addresses FormArray. We call this method anytime we want to
    create another instance of the FormGroup and add it to our FormArray. Next, we add a button to the HTML. We'll put
    it inside the ngIf so it does not appear unless the user checked Send me your catalog, but outside of the FormArray
    so it is not duplicated. This button binds the click event to our new addAddress method. I've added a binding to the
    disabled property as well, so that the user cannot add another address if any prior address is invalid, but we don't
    currently have any validation in the address FormControls, feel free to add some as you wish. Let's try this out in
    the browser. As always we see one address block, we can fill it out, and click Add Another Address, and we
    dynamically duplicate our address block. We can fill that one in and click the button again. We can continue to add
    everyone on our shopping list. Notice that if we click in the label of Street Address 1, focus is set to the correct
    copy of the input box. Our bound input element IDs are working as expected. Clicking on the label does not work for
    the other controls. Notice it put the focus up here. This is because we have not yet changed them to use the index
    as part of the ID. And look at our Value property, our FormArray has an entry for each address FormGroup, we can
    access those elements and their properties as needed. To see how that's done, let's add another binding at the
    bottom of the form. This displays the street address of the first address FormGroup. We use our addresses property
    getter and call its get method, passing in the index of the desired FormGroup along with the name of the FormControl
    within that FormGroup. We add the safe navigation operator in case that element is not found. Going back to the
    browser, if we type in to the Street 1 input element, we see its value here at the bottom. We have successfully
    duplicated our address FormGroup as many times as the user requests, yay. Let's finish up this module with a
    checklist.</p>

<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>

<p>For this module, what better checklist than our steps. We first define the input element or set of input elements
    that we want to duplicate. In our example, it was an entire address block. We then define a FormGroup containing the
    FormControls that we want to duplicate, in our case our address FormControls. Then we refactor the FormBuilder code
    to create the instance of the FormControl or nested FormGroup within a method. Next, we create a FormArray to retain
    those multiple instances. In the HTML we loop through the FormArray, and display copies of the input elements for
    each FormControl or FormGroup in the FormArray. Lastly, we provide a way for the user to specify when to make a copy
    of the input elements. In our example, we added a button the user could click to add another address block. When the
    user clicks the button, a method in the component class creates another instance of the FormControl or nested
    FormGroup, and adds it to the FormArray. The ngFor and the HTML makes a copy of the address block for each FormArray
    entry, effectively dynamically duplicating the input elements. In this module, we provided a way for the user to
    dynamically duplicate input elements. We first outlined the set of steps required to achieve this task, and then
    walked through each step. Along the way we learned about FormArrays and how to leverage them to manage multiple
    instances of a FormGroup or FormControl. Our demo form now demonstrates building a form the Reactive way, and
    includes features such as displaying validation messages from the component class, cross-field validation, watching
    the notifications element and reacting by changing the validation rules, performing custom validation for the rating
    range, and dynamically duplicating input elements. Next up, let's put away our demo form and look at a Reactive form
    within a more full-featured application.</p>
