<h2>Reactive Form in Context</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Now's the time to shift gears a bit, and see how a Reactive form fits into a larger scale application. Welcome back
    to Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module we look at how an edit
    form works within the context of a more full-featured Angular application. Rarely is a form the entirety of an
    application, rather it is a piece of a larger puzzle. In addition to understanding the basics of building a Reactive
    form, to fit the form piece into the context of a larger application, we need to consider how the user will navigate
    to the form, how to set up validation for reuse, and how to populate data into, and save data from the form. In this
    module, we concentrate on additional concepts and requirements when building a Reactive form within the context of a
    full-featured application. We start with an overview of the sample application we'll use in these next two modules.
    Then we focus on the code for routing to the form, reading the route parameter passed to the form so we know which
    item the user selected to edit, setting up a deactivate routing guard to remind the user to save before navigating
    away, and refactoring custom validation into a separate class for reusability. We'll look at retrieving and saving
    data from the form in the next module. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Sample Application</h3>

<p>In the next two modules, we'll examine the code for a Reactive form in the context of a more full-featured
    application, called APM for Acme Product Management. It manages a list of products that Acme sells. The completed
    code for this sample application is available in my GitHub repository, here. If you want to follow along with your
    own copy of this code, clone the repo, or download it as a zip file and unzip it, then in the APM folder, use npm
    install to install the required packages. I've opened the APM folder in VS Code. Let's start by running the sample
    application using npm start. This is Acme Product Management. I walk through building the basic features of this
    sample application in the Angular 2: Getting Started course here on Pluralsight. If you've taken that course, this
    application will look familiar. I've added a Reactive form to this sample application so we can see an edit form in
    context. We are looking at the Welcome page. Click Product List to review the list of products. Notice the product
    rating stars. Using stars instead of a number makes it easier for the user to visualize the rating. We can use the
    Filter by box to filter the list of products, or clear the filter to view all products. Notice that each row has an
    Edit button. Click the product name to view the product details. Click the Edit button to display the product edit
    form. Notice that the form populates with the existing product data, yay. From here the user can edit any of this
    data, validation messages appear as needed. If we remove the product name, we see a validation message. If we put in
    a star rating out of the valid range, we see a validation message. Because of our validation errors the Save button
    is currently disabled. When we fix the errors, the errors disappear, and the Save button is enabled. Notice this Add
    Tag button. It allows us to dynamically duplicate the tag input element, and add search tags for this product. This
    is similar to the multiple addresses we implemented in the demo form. Click Save to save our product, and we see the
    changed item in the product list. To add a new product, click the Add Product menu option. The form is then
    displayed initialized for us to enter a new product. We can then fill out the form, and click Save. Our new product
    appears in the list. Our current form does not have fields for availability date and price, so those are empty here.
    Notice that if we refresh, these changes are gone. We are using an in-memory Web API server, so our changes are only
    retained in memory. We'll talk more about that in the next module. Though not a large application, Acme Product
    Management does provide enough features to see how all of the moving parts work together. Let's look at the
    architecture of this application.</p>

<h3>Sample Application: Architecture</h3>

<p>When building an Angular application, we break the features and user interface pieces into components. For the APM
    sample application, we have a main application component called App component, and a component for each primary page
    of the application. The Welcome page has a Welcome component. The solid line here represents route navigation, the
    user can navigate from the menu, defined in the App component, to the Welcome page, defined in the Welcome
    component. The Product List page has a Product List component. To provide the filtering feature, the application has
    a product filter pipe. The Detail page has its own component, and we can route to the Detail page from the Product
    List page. Both the Product List and Product Detail components use a nested component to display the star rating
    implemented in the Star component. Because this course is on Reactive forms, we'll focus on the Edit page defined in
    the Product Edit component. We can navigate to the Edit page from the Add Product menu option, defined in the App
    component, or from the Edit button on the Product List or Product Detail pages. This sample application includes a
    product data service, which gets the data for our components. In the next module, we'll see how to implement,
    create, read, update, and delete in this data service, and use it in the Product Edit component. Once we have our
    components and other pieces of our application defined, we organize them into Angular modules. For the APM sample
    application, we divided the application pieces into three Angular modules, AppModule for the basic application and
    startup pieces, ProductModule for the product feature pieces, and SharedModule for pieces sharable across our
    feature modules. AppModule is the root application module and contains the root and startup components of the
    application. Our App and Welcome components go here. We import the BrowserModule, HttpModule, and RouterModule, and
    pull in the ProductModule. ProductModule is a feature module that contains all of the pieces for the product
    features. Our product feature pages, pipes, and services go here. Our product feature uses Reactive forms and
    routing, so we import the associated modules here, and pull in the SharedModule. SharedModule, as its name suggests,
    is a module that can be shared between all of the feature modules. We only have one feature module, but could easily
    add more to implement customers or invoices, for example. Our StarComponent goes here so it can be reused by any
    feature, and we export CommonModule and FormsModule, so they can also be used by any feature. Note that even though
    our ProductEditComponent uses Reactive forms, and therefore requires the ReactiveFormsModule, we are still using
    ngModel in the ProductListComponent for the filter by box, so the ProductListComponent needs the FormsModule. We
    have the FormsModule in the SharedModule so that any other component can use ngModel as well. If we plan to use
    Reactive forms throughout our application, we could move the ReactiveFormsModule to the SharedModule, and export it,
    so it can be used by any feature. Note that we do not need to declare any of our simple classes within an Angular
    module, so our validation classes are not depicted here. In this course module, we'll focus on the
    ProductEditComponent and ProductEditGuard. In the next course module, we'll focus on the ProductService and how the
    ProductEditComponent uses that service. Let's take a look at the code.</p>

<h3>Sample Application: Code</h3>

<p>Here is the code for the Acme Product Management application. The majority of this code was built step by step in the
    Angular 2: Getting Started course. Our focus here is on the product-edit form. If you want more information about
    any of the other files here, check out the Getting Started course. I've added three files in the product folder,
    product-edit.component.html for the template, product-edit.component.ts for the component class, and the
    product-data class. We'll look at the product-data class in the next course module. Let's start with the
    product-edit.component. When working with Reactive forms, one of the key tasks for the component class is to define
    the form model, we do that here in the ngOnInit. When the component is initialized we build the root FormGroup. The
    form element and the HTML binds to this root FormGroup, using the FormGroup directive. The productName has no
    default value, is required, has a minLength of 3, and a maxLength of 50, but wait, doesn't the productName need to
    default to the current name of the product? The problem is that we don't yet have that data here in the ngOnInit
    method. We'll need to go off to the server to get it, so we can't get the default values until the data is retrieved
    from the server and returned in an HTTP response. So at this point, there is no default value. We'll see how to set
    the default values from the HTTP response in the next module. The productCode has no default value at this point
    either, and is required. The starRating also has no default and uses a custom validator. This is the same range
    validator we created earlier in this course. Because it is a validator that we may want to reuse, I've moved it to
    its own file in the shared folder. We'll look at that a little later in this module. Lastly is the product
    description, which also has no default value set at this point, and it has no validation rules. And here is the
    FormArray for the search tag. Recall that the search tags are dynamically duplicated on the form when the user
    clicks the Add Tag button. It is initialized to an empty array. The code to work with this FormArray is similar to
    the code we wrote in the demo form to manage the address block FormArray. Next, let's look at the
    ProductFeatureModule. In Angular, every component needs to belong to an Angular module, and it makes sense that our
    new ProductEditComponent would belong to the ProductFeatureModule. We import the ProductEditComponent with an import
    statement here, then add it to the declarations array here. I've added a few other things here as well. As we know
    from earlier in this course, to use Reactive forms we need to import the ReactiveFormsModule. We add it to the
    imports array here. I've also added the InMemoryWebApiModule, we'll talk more about that in the next course module.
    And here is the route configuration for the product features, including the route to our ProductEditComponent. Let's
    take a closer look at how to navigate to our ProductEditComponent, and display our edit form.</p>

<h3>Routing to a Form</h3>

<p>Anytime we add a feature to our application, such as a product edit form, we need to define some way for the user to
    navigate to that feature. In Angular we define our application navigation with routing. Setting up routing requires
    three steps, configuring the routes, activating the routes based on a user action, and lastly identifying where to
    place the activated components template. The first step is to configure the routes with a list of route definitions,
    each definition specifies a route object. The path property defines the URL path segment for the route. When this
    route is activated, this URL path segment is appended to the URL of our application. In most cases, we also specify
    a component, which is the component associated with the route. It is this component's template that is displayed
    when the route is activated. This first route simply maps a specific URL path segment to a specific component. The
    id in the second and third routes represents a route parameter. The Product Edit page displays a form for editing
    one product, so it needs to know which product to display. The ProductEditComponent reads the ID from the path
    segment, and displays the defined product in the form. There may be times that we want to limit access to a route.
    We want routes only accessible to specific users, such as an administrator, for example, or we want the user to
    confirm a navigation operation, such as asking whether to save before navigating away from an edit page. For that we
    use routing guards. We build the guards using the same techniques as building an Angular service, then we attach the
    desired guards to the routes in the route configuration. In this example, the product detail route has a canActivate
    guard, which checks specific criteria before allowing navigation to a particular route. The productEdit route has a
    canDeactivate guard, which checks specific criteria before allowing navigation away from a particular route. Let's
    see this in the context of the APM application. The route configuration is defined in an Angular module. Our product
    routes are in our ProductFeatureModule. Here is the route to the ProductEditComponent. We specify productEdit as the
    path URL fragment. Because we need to know which product to display for editing, we use the colon to identify a
    placeholder variable for the ID of the product to edit. We'll pass that ID on the URL to the ProductEditComponent
    when this route is activated. We want to guard against the user leaving the form when there are unsaved changes, so
    we define a canDeactivate guard. We'll look at the code for this guard later in this module. Next, we need to define
    the UI elements to activate this route. We want to display the product form for edit from the Product List page, and
    from the Product Detail page. We also display the product edit form when the Add Product menu option is selected to
    add a new product. We tie routes to actions using the routerLink directive. We use property binding to bind the
    routerLink directive to an array. The first element in the array is the route to activate. The second element is the
    data to pass to that route. Here we pass 0 to the productEdit route, what does this 0 mean? The implementation rules
    for the APM application define an ID of 0 to mean a request for a new product. It has no special meaning, other than
    that which we give it. Because of this implementation rule, anytime the productEdit URL path segment includes a 0
    ID, the code will infer that the user wants to add a new product. Let's take a look. The menu for this application
    is defined with an inline template in the AppComponent, so it is here that we see the Add Product menu option. It
    uses the routerLink directive to activate the route. This syntax is a shortcut for what we saw in the slide. Since
    we are always passing a 0 here, we just add it as part of the URL segment, instead of passing it separately in a
    second element of the array. What about the Edit button? In the product-list.component the Edit button is down here.
    It uses the routerLink directive to activate the route. Here we pass the ID of the product so that the productEdit
    component knows which product to edit. The code for the Product Detail button is similar. Now we've configured the
    routes and tied the routerLink directive to appropriate UI elements so the user can activate the productEdit route.
    When a route is activated, the associated components view is displayed, but displayed where? How do we specify where
    we want the routed component to display its view? We use the router-outlet directive. The routed component's view
    then appears in this location. Let's take a look. Here in our AppComponent we use the router-outlet directive to
    specify where the routed template should appear, so each page is displayed here under the menu, including our
    Product Edit page. Let's view it in the browser. When we click Add Product from the menu, the URL changes to
    productEdit with 0 as the product ID. The edit form is then displayed and set up for entry of a new product. When we
    click to edit a product, the URL changes to include productEdit and the ID of the selected product. The edit form
    now displays the data for that selected product. For the product edit form to display the data for the correct
    product, it needs to read that product ID parameter from the route URL. Let's look at how to do that next.</p>

<h3>Reading a Route Parameter</h3>

<p>Here again is the route configuration for the productEdit route. To display the appropriate product in the product
    edit form, the ProductEditComponent needs to read the passed in parameter from the route URL. To get the parameter
    from the URL, we use the ActivatedRoute service provided by the router. We want an instance of this service, so we
    define it as a dependency in our constructor. We use the instance of the ActivatedRoute to get the desired
    parameter. There are two ways to get the parameter from the ActivatedRoute, using a snapshot or using an observable.
    Use the snapshot if you only need to get the initial value of the parameter, the code is then a one liner as shown
    here. If you expect the parameter to change without leaving the page, use an observable instead. The observable
    provides notification when the URL parameter changes. For example, the user could click Add Product while on the
    Product Edit form, so the URL could change to 0 without leaving the page. Because of this we want to use the
    observable approach in the productEdit component. Let's take a look. In the product-edit.component, we need to read
    the product ID from the route, so we know which product to edit, or if the user is requesting to create a new
    product. For this task the code needs the ActivatedRoute from the router. We import it here, and inject its service
    using the constructor here. We set up the route parameter observable in the OnInit lifecycle hook, here is where the
    code subscribes to the route parameters. Every time the parameter changes this code get notified, the ID is pulled
    from the provided parameter array, and the code calls getProduct to get the product data for this ID. We'll look at
    getting the data in the next module. To ensure the subscription is appropriately cleaned up, this code uses the
    ngOnDestroy to unsubscribe, but to unsubscribe from an observable we need to have the subscription, so we define a
    private property sub that retains the reference to this subscription so we can unsubscribe from it. Let's see this
    in the browser. Let's edit the hammer. Notice the URL change, then the Product Edit page appears. If I click on Add
    Product, the Product Edit page input elements are initialized and ready for entry of a new product. This works
    because we are watching for changes to the URL parameters. Now watch what happens if I change something and try to
    leave the page, I get a message asking if I want to navigate away and lose my changes. This could be a very helpful
    feature for a user that just created a new product and then distractedly navigated away. Let's see how we set up
    this route guard.</p>

<h3>Setting a canDeactivate Guard</h3>

<p>Building a guard follows the common pattern used throughout Angular, create a class, add a decorator, import what we
    need. Here we define a ProductEditGuard class, since we are implementing this guard as a service we use the
    Injectable decorator, and we import what we need. This class implements canDeactivate. Notice this syntax, it
    includes a generic parameter that specifies the associated component. This code implements the canDeactivate method,
    passing in the specified component. For simple cases, this method can return a Boolean value, true to deactivate the
    route, and false to cancel the route deactivation. For more complex cases, this could return an observable or a
    promise. Let's take a look. The guards used in this sample application are very specific to products, so they are in
    the products folder, in the product-guard.service.ts file. We have two guards in here. The ProductDetailGuard
    ensures that the user cannot navigate to the ProductDetailRoute unless the URL contains a valid product ID. The
    ProductEditGuard checks the form's dirty state. If the form is dirty, it asks the user to confirm the navigation.
    The canDeactivate method passes in the component. Code in the method can then access the component properties. In
    this example, the code uses the productForm property, which is the reference to the form model. It then checks the
    dirty property to determine if the user has made any changes to the form. If so, the code notifies the user, and
    requests a confirmation before navigating away from the Product Edit page, or navigating to a different product.
    Before we can use a guard, we need to register the service provider in an Angular module. We import the guard using
    an import statement here, then register the provider for the guard here. The last step is to tie the guard to the
    appropriate route. The guards are specified as part of the route configuration. Here we specify canDeactivate and
    provide an array of guards, we only have one so we specify that here. Let's see this in the browser. We'll navigate
    to the Edit page, make a change, and select to Add a Product. We see the message provided by the canDeactivate route
    guard. Note that the canDeactivate only works when navigating within the Angular application, it does not check the
    guard if the user navigates to an entirely different site, or closes the browser. Looking again at this form, it
    uses a range validator similar to the one we built in the demo form earlier in this course. Let's see how that
    validator was changed in the context of the APM application.</p>

<h3>Refactoring to a Custom Validation Class</h3>

<p>Earlier in this course, we defined a range validator in our demo form component using code similar to this. This
    range validator required parameters for the minimum and maximum values for the range. This meant that we had to wrap
    the validator function in a factory function, as shown here. In the demo form application, we put this function
    within the form's component code file, making the validator more difficult to discover and reuse by other forms in
    the application. We could instead define this validator in its own file. Let's take a look. Since the range
    validator can be shared with any form that needs it, including a template-driven form, I added it to the shared
    folder. Under the shared folder is number.validator.ts. This file is set up to hold any number validator, assuming
    over time we may have more than just this range validator. Within this file we import what we need, then we define a
    class that we export. This makes it easy to reuse any number validators, defined here, in any of our components. We
    mark the method as static so that any code can use it without creating an instance of this class. The remainder of
    this code is as we saw it in the demo form component we built earlier in this course. To use this validator in a
    form component such as the product-edit.component, we import the validator using an import statement, then use it
    like any other validator when building the form model here. Let's try it out in the browser, we'll again edit the
    hammer. Here on the form we enter 0 and see a validation message, we enter 5 and the validation message disappears,
    enter 6 and the validation message reappears. Bottom line, it's easy to take a local validator function or factory
    function that returns a validator function and move it into a separate class. The validator is then easier to
    discover because it is in the shared folder, and easier to reuse because we can simply import it. Let's move on to
    the fun bits, retrieving and saving data, but first a quick checklist.</p>

<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>

<p>When building a form in the context of a more full-featured application, we need to add a route configuration to
    route to the form, add user interface elements to activate the route, such as an Edit button, read the route
    parameter passed to the form to edit the appropriate item, optionally set up a canDeactivate guard to remind the
    user to save before navigating away, and optionally refactor any locally-defined validator functions to a custom
    validator class for reuse within the application. In this module, we saw how a Reactive form is often just a piece
    of the puzzle of a larger application. We examined how to route to the form, and how to read the route parameters in
    the component class to identify the appropriate item to edit. We saw how to set up a canDeactivate guard to provide
    a notification message if the user navigates away from the form with unsaved changes. And we discovered how to
    refactor a local validator function into a custom validator class for reusability. Next up, let's see how to get
    data into our form and save the user's changes.</p>
