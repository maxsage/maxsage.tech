    <h2>Building Nested Components</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Our user interface design may include features that are complex enough to be separate components, or that are
      reusable across our views. Welcome back to "Angular 2: Getting Started" from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah
      Kurata and in this module we see how to build components designed to be nested within other components, and we'll
      discover how to establish communication between the nested component and its container. Just like nesting dolls,
      we can nest our components. We can nest a component within another component and nest that component within yet
      another component and so on. And because each component is fully encapsulated we expose specific inputs and
      outputs for communication between a nested component and its container, allowing them to pass data back and
      forth. There are two ways to use a component and display the component's template. We can use a component as a
      directive. We saw how to use a component as a directive when we displayed the App Component template in the
      index.html file. The mh-app directive is defined as the App Component selector. The template is then displayed
      within the directive text. We use the same technique with nested components. Alternatively, we can use the
      component as a routing target, so it appears to the user that they've traveled to another view. The template is
      then displayed in a full page style view. We'll use this technique later in this course to route to our Product
      List View. Our Product List View is currently used as a directive, but that's only because we have not yet covered
      routing. In this course module we'll focus on building a nested component. So, what makes a component nest-able?
      Technically speaking, any of our components could be nested if they have a selector defined in the component
      decorator. But, does it really make sense to nest a large view such as our Product List? For our purposes we'll
      define a component as nest-able if its template only manages a fragment of a larger view, if it has a selector so
      it can be used as a directive, and, optionally, if it communicates with its container. In this module we'll build
      a nested component, then we'll review how to use that nested component as a directive in a container component.
      We'll examine how to pass data to the nested component using a property with the @Input decorator. And how to pass
      data out of the nested component by raising an event to find with the @Output decorator. In our sample
      application, to improve the user experience we want to replace the rating number displayed in the Product List
      Component with stars. In this module we'll build the Star Component and nest it within the Product List Component.
      Let's get started.</p>
    <h3>Building a Nested Component</h3>
    <p>Here is a visual representation of a component that is nest-able. Here is another component. It wants to use the
      nest-able component in its template. We then refer to the outer component as the container or parent component.
      And we refer to the inner component as the nested or child component. When building an interactive application the
      nested component often needs to communicate with its container. The nested component receives information from its
      container using input properties, and the nested component outputs information back to its container by raising
      events. In our sample application we want to change the display of the five-star rating from this to
      this. Displaying the rating number using a visual representation such as stars makes it quicker and easier for the
      user to interpret the meaning of the number. This is the nested component we'll build in this module. For the Star
      Component to display the correct number of stars, the container must provide the rating number to our Star
      Component as an input. And if the user clicks on the stars we want to raise an event to notify the container.
      Let's jump right in and build our Star Component. When we last saw our sample application we had completed the
      Product List Component. Now, of course, we want to change it. Instead of displaying a number for the rating here
      we want to display stars. Instead of adding the code to the Product List Component to display the stars, we want
      to build it as a separate component. This keeps the template and logic for that feature encapsulated and makes it
      reusable. So let's begin by creating a Star Component. The Star Component can be used by any feature of the
      application, so it really doesn't belong in our Products folder, we'll instead put it in a shared folder where
      we'll put all our shared components. If you are using the starter files I've already created this folder and
      included the template and style sheet for our component here. Now we are ready to build the Star Component. We
      begin by creating a new file. We'll name it "star.component.ts". We then create this component just like we'd
      create any other component, starting with the class. export class StarComponent. What's next? Yup, we decorate the
      class with the component decorator. Recall that it is this component decorator that makes this class a component.
      As always, it shows as a syntax error here because we're missing, yup, our import. Now, we're ready to set the
      component decorator properties. For the selector we don't want to use the pm prefix because this component could
      be reused anywhere in our company, not just on the Product Management Application. We'll instead prefix the
      selector with an abbreviation for our company, which in this case is "ai" for "Acme Inc". For the templateurl we
      provide the path to the HTML file provided in our starter files. We add the styleurls property, and in the array
      we'll set the first element to the path of the style sheet that was also provided. Now let's take a peek at the
      Star Component template. Here it displays five stars, it then crops the stars based on a defined width. This
      technique can then display partial stars such as four and a half of the five stars by setting the width, such that
      only four and a half of the stars appear. Recall what this syntax is called? This is property binding. We're using
      it here to set the style width, and here to bind the title property to display the numerical rating value. For
      theses bindings to work we need two properties and the component's class, the rating and the star width. Let's add
      these two properties. We want the rating property, which is a number and defines the rating value. Since we don't
      yet have a way to get this value let's hardcode it to four for now so we'll see some stars. And we need the star
      width. This value is calculated based on the rating. So, where do we put that calculation? Well, we'd want to
      start width recalculated anytime the container changes the rating number, so let's tap into the OnChanges
      lifecycle hook as we discussed in the last module. We'll add OnChanges to the import statement. We'll implement
      the OnChanges interface and we'll write code for the ngOnChanges method, identified the OnChanges interface. In
      this method we'll convert the rating number to a star width based on the width of our stars. Our component is now
      complete and we're ready to nest it in another component. How do we do that?</p>
    <h3>Using a Nested Component</h3>
    <p>Now we are ready to nest our new component>within another component.>We do that by using our nested component as
      a directive, and following the same steps we covered earlier in this course. Here is a shorten form of the code
      for a container component and its template. And here is the nested component we just created. Instead of
      displaying the star rating number we want to display the stars, so the container component uses the nested
      component by specifying its directive here. This identifies where in the container to place the nested component's
      template. As we've seen in prior demos, when we use a component as a directive we need to tell Angular how to find
      that directive. We do that by declaring the nested component in an Angular module. How do we know which Angular
      module? Well, you still only have one Angular module, AppModule, but if we had multiple modules we'd add it to
      each Angular module that declares a component that uses the directive. In our example, the Product List
      Component's template wants to use the Star Component, so we add the declaration to the same Angular module that
      declares the Product List Component. We define the nested component in the declaration's array of the @NgModule
      decorator, and as always, define what we need by adding an import statement. Let's jump right back to our demo.
      Our Star Component is now shown here in the right. We want to use our Star Component in the Product List
      template that is here on the left. In the table data element we want to replace the display of the star rating
      number with our Star Component. To do that we simply replace the binding with our ai-star directive. Now our
      Product List template will display our stars here. Next we need to tell Angular where to find this directive.
      Since we only have one Angular module we'll add the declaration for the nested component there. Because we know by
      now that we'll need it, we'll add the import for the Star Component first, then we add the Star Component to the
      declaration's array passed into the @NgModule decorator. And since we imported the component first, IntelliSense
      helps us here. These are the same steps we followed earlier on this course to use a component as a directive.
      Nothing new here so far. Let's see what we did. We have stars! Yes! Hmm, but we see five of them. Let's clear up
      the filter. Yes, we see five every time. Hover over the stars and we see our hardcoded star rating is four. It
      seems that our star width is not being set. Let's look at the code again. We set the star width property in the
      ngOnChanges method when the OnChanges lifecyle event occurs, but the OnChanges lifecycle event never occurs
      because OnChanges only watches for changes to input properties. We don't have any input properties. So we have two
      problems here: our OnChanges event does not fire and we don't currently have a way to get the correct rating
      number from the container. Let's see how input properties can solve both of these issues. </p>
    <h3>Passing Data to a Nested Component Using @Input</h3>
    <p>If a nested component wants to receive input from its container, it must expose a property to that container. The
      nested component exposes a property it can use to receive input from its container using the aptly named "@Input"
      decorator. We use the @Input decorator to decorate any property in the nested component's class. This works with
      any property type, including an object. In this example, we want the rating number passed into the nested
      component, so we mark that property with the @Input decorator. The container component then passes data to the
      nest component by setting this property with property binding. When using property binding we enclose the binding
      target in square brackets, we set the binding source to the data that the container wants to pass to the nested
      component. In this example the Product List template passes the product's star rating number. The only time we can
      specify a nested component's property as a property binding target on the left side of an equals is when that
      property is decorated with the @Input decorator. So in this example the Product List template can bind to the
      rating but not the star width. Let's give this a try. Going back to our Star Component let's add @Input to our
      import statement 'cause we know we're going to need it. The Star Component wants to expose the rating property to
      its container so the container can provide the rating number. We'll add the @Input decorator then to the rating
      property. The @Input decorator is a function, so we add parenthesis. We don't need to pass anything to this
      function, so that's it. And let's remove this default value. Now that we can get the value from the container we
      don't need that here. In our example we decorate only one property of the nested component with the @Input
      decorator but we are not limited to one, we can expose multiple input properties as needed. In the container's
      template we use property binding and define the nested component's input property as the target of the binding.
      Then we set the binding source to the value we want to pass into the nested component. In this example, we pass
      the product's star rating. That's it, the product's star rating property is now bound to the rating input property
      of the nested component. Anytime the container data changes, the OnChanges lifecycle event is generated and the
      star width is recalculated, the appropriate number of stars are then displayed. Let's check it out in the browser.
      That looks better. Well, we're not really displaying the .2 stars here, our algorithm could use some improvement,
      but you get the idea. But, what if we want to send data back from our nested component to our container? Let's
      look at that next.</p>
    <h3>Passing Data from a Component Using @Output</h3>
    <p>We just saw how the container passes data to the nested component by binding to a nested component property that
      is decorated with the @Input decorator. If the nested component wants to send information back to its container,
      it can raise an event. The nested component exposes an event it can use to pass output to its container using the
      aptly named "@Output" decorator. We can use the @Output decorator to decorate any property of the nested
      component's class. However, the property type must be an event. The only was a nested component can pass data back
      to its container is with an event. The data to pass becomes the event payload. In Angular an event is defined with
      an EventEmitter object, so here we create a new instance of an EventEmitter. Notice the syntax here. TypeScript
      supports generics. If you are not familiar with generics, this syntax allows us to identify a specific type that
      the object instance will work with. When creating an EventEmitter, the generic argument identifies the type of the
      event payload. If we want to pass a string value to the container in the event payload, we define "string" here.
      If we want to pass an integer, we define "number" here. If we want to pass multiple values, we can specify an
      "object" here. In this example we define a notify event with a string payload. When the user clicks on the stars
      the Star Component receives that click event, we use event binding in the Star Component template to call the Star
      Component's onClick method. In the onClick method we use the notify event property and call its emit method to
      raise the notify event to the container. If we want to pass data in the event payload, we pass that data into the
      emit method. In this example the onClick method raises the notify event and sets the event payload to a string
      message. The container component receives that event with the specified payload. In the container component's
      template we use event binding to bind to this notify event and call a method. We access the event payload using
      "$event". The only time we can specify a nested component's property as an event binding target on the left side
      of an equals is when that property is decorated with the @Output decorator. Lastly, the container component
      provides the method to execute when the notify event occurs. Since the event payload is a string, this function
      takes in a string. Here we can perform any desired action. Hmm, lots of moving parts here. Let's jump into the
      code and try it out. We are back in the sample application looking at the Star Component. We'll add @Output and
      EventEmitter to our import statement because we know we're going to need 'em. We want to expose an event to the
      container, so let's define a ratingClicked event property. We define the type of this property to be EventEmitter,
      and we want the event payload to be a string, so we specify "string" as the generic argument. We set the
      ratingClicked property to new instance of EventEmitter. We decorate this property with the @Output decorator to
      expose it so that the container can respond to this event. The @Output decorator is a function so we add
      parenthesis. In this example we are decorating only one property of the nested component with the @Output
      decorator but we are not limited to one, we can expose multiple output properties as needed. Moving to the
      template, we use event binding to bind the div element's clicked event to a local onClick method. Then let's
      implement this onClick method in the component. When the Star Component processes the clicked event on the div, it
      wants to raise an event to the container and pass along a message. We use the event property and call its emit
      method passing in the desired string. In this example, we use the ES2015 back text to define a template
      string, this allows us to bind the rating directly into the string using dollar syntax. Our Star Component is then
      complete. Now, let's respond to this event in our container. The Product List Component wants to listen for this
      ratingClicked event, so let's update the Product List template. Here, in the nested component's directive, we'll
      add event binding to respond to the ratingClicked event exposed by the Star Component, and we'll get the event
      payload. We'll respond by calling our own local method, we'll call it onRatingClicked. The event payload is
      available using $event, so we pass that in to the onRatingClicked method. We then need to write code for this new
      method in the container's class. In the Product List Component we define the onRatingClicked method. We'll add it
      on the bottom with our other methods. We define a "message: string" parameter for the event payload. To keep
      things simple, we'll just modify the pageTitle to display "Product List" and the message from the nested
      component. Okay, yeah, that is not a very real world example but I wanted to keep this as straightforward as
      possible. We'd have a better example if the nested component contained an input box and we could pass the user's
      input in the event payload, but you get the general idea here. Let's see how this works in the browser. We'll
      clear filter by, click on the star rating, and we see the page title changed to display the message received from
      the nested component. Success! We just saw how the container passes data to the nested component by binding to a
      nest component property that is decorated with the @Input decorator, and how the nested component uses an event
      property decorated with the @Output decorator to raise events. We can think of the properties decorated with the
      @Input or @Output decorators as a public API of the nest-able component. Everything else in the component is
      encapsulated and only accessible to the component's template and class. Let's finish up this module with some
      checklists we can use as we build nest-able components. </p>
    <h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
    <p>We build a nested component using the same techniques we use to build any other Angular component. We won't
      review that again here, let's instead lay out a checklist for inputs and outputs. Decorate a nested component
      property with the Input decorator any time it needs input data from its container. Any type of component property
      can be decorated with the Input decorator. Don't forget the @ prefix, and since the Input decorator is a function,
      follow it with opening-closing parenthesis. Decorate a nested component property with the Output decorator anytime
      it needs to raise events and optionally pass information back to its container. Only properties of type
      EventEmitter should be marked with the Output decorator. Use the EventEmitter's generic argument to specify the
      type of the event payload. And use the "new" keyword to create an instance of the EventEmitter. Don't forget the @
      prefix, and since the Output decorator is a function suffix it with opening-closing parenthesis. In a container
      component's template use the nested component as a directive. For the name of the directive see the nested
      component's selector property. Use property binding to pass data to the nested component. Any property of the
      nested component that is decorated with the Input decorator can be used as a binding target. Use event binding to
      respond to events from the nested component. Any event that is decorated with the Output decorator can be used as
      the binding target. And use $event to access the event payload passed from the nested component. This module was
      all about nested components. We began by building a component that could be nested within other components. We
      then walked through how to use the nested component within a container. We saw how to pass data into the nested
      component by binding to a property marked with the Input decorator. And we discovered how to pass data out of the
      nested component by raising an event marked with the Output decorator. In this module we built the Star
      Component and nested it within the Product List Component. We can reuse this component in any other component of
      the application such as the Product Detail Component. Next up, let's check out how to build an Angular service so
      we won't need hardcoded product data in our component.
