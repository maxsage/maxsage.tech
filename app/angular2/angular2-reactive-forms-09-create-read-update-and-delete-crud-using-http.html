<h2>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) Using HTTP</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The key purpose of a form, in many scenarios, is to collect or edit data. Welcome back to Angular 2: Reactive Forms,
    from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module, we deal with CRUD, or to say that another way,
    Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for retrieving and saving data to a back-end server with HTTP. Many
    Angular applications obtain data using HTTP. The application issues an HTTP get request to a web service on a web
    server. At some future point in time, that web service processes the request, retrieves the data, often from a
    database, and returns that data to the application in an HTTP response. The application then processes that data.
    Note that I said, at some future point in time. HTTP requests are asynchronous. We send a request, then continue
    about our processing, handling other user interactions as needed. At some future point in time, the request is
    processed, and we receive the response. The user then enters or updates information, and selects to save. The
    application issues a post or a put request to a web service, passing along the entered data. At some future point in
    time, that web service processes the request, stores the data, and returns an HTTP response. The application then
    processes that response, which may contain the updated data. Notice that I again said, at some future point in time.
    Working with HTTP requests and responses requires working asynchronously. In this module, we examine the Data Access
    Service for our data operations, including creating new data, retrieving the data for displaying the form,
    processing user updates to existing data, and deleting existing data. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Data Access Service</h3>

<p>Here again is the architecture of our sample APM application. We defined a component for each view in our
    application, and a Product Data Service to encapsulate all of the HTTP communication for our products. Why? Why
    create a separate service? Why not just put the data access logic in the component that needs it? One reason to
    build a Data Access Service is separation of concerns. Let each component focus only on the logic required to
    display its template and handle its interactions. And let the Data Access Service focus only on the communication
    with the HTTP server. By separating concerns, each piece of the application can focus on what it does best. Putting
    the data access logic in a Data Access Service also provide reusability. The Product List component needs to
    retrieve product data, the Product Detail component needs to retrieve product data, and the Product Edit component
    needs to retrieve product data. Instead of repeating that code in each component, the components can share the
    functionality provided by the Data Access Service. Another benefit of using a Data Access Service, is that is can
    share the data itself with all of the components. The Data Access component could retrieve the data one time, and
    share that data with all of the components that need it. The next question then is how? How do we send an HTTP
    request from a Data Access Service? Here is a Data Access Service called Product Data Service. The back-end web
    server can be hosting a Node server, ASP.NET Web API, PHP, Rails, or whatever, Angular doesn't care, the Product
    Data Service communicates with our back-end web server using Angular's built-in Http Service. The Product Data
    Service issues a request, such as a get request, to the Angular Http Service, which in turn issues the request to
    the back-end web server. At some future point in time, the back-end web server processes the request, and returns
    the response. Angular's Http Service forwards that response on to the Product Data Service. To build a Data Access
    Service, we first need to register the provider for the built-in Angular Http Service. Next we create a class for
    the Data Access Service, and register the service provider. Then we inject the Angular Http Service using the class
    constructor, so we can use it in the Data Access Service. We import observables and the observable operators that we
    need. Observables help us manage asynchronous data, such as data coming from a back-end server. We need them here
    because working with requests and responses means we're working asynchronously, so Angular's Http Service returns
    observables. Lastly, we write the code to issue each HTTP request that we need, get, post, put, delete, and so on.
    Let's dive into a demo and look at the code required for each of these steps.</p>

<h3>Data Access Service: Demo</h3>

<p>In this demo, we'll look at the basic code required to build a Data Access Service. Our first step is to register the
    built-in Angular Http Service, the question is where? Where should we register this service? We can register a
    service within a specific component or within an Angular module. Since we want to use the Http Service from our own
    Data Access Service, not a specific component, we'll register it within an Angular module. When registering a
    service with an Angular module, the service is registered with the root injector, so it really doesn't matter which
    Angular module we inject it in. My rule of thumb is to put it where I'd think to find it later. If I had a core
    module, I'd add it there with my other services. But since there is no core module defined in this particular
    application, the next best place is probably the app.module. The HttpModule is imported here with an import
    statement, then added to the imports array here. The HttpModule registers the Http Service, so it is then ready for
    us to inject and use. The next step is to create the Data Access Service class. Because the service is specifically
    for product data, this service resides in the products folder, its named product.service.ts. In Angular a service is
    defined in a class. In this example, we call it ProductService, we optionally decorate a service using the
    Injectable decorator. As with every Angular service, we need to register it. To keep all of the product code
    together, we'll register it in the product.module. We import the service with the import statement here, then add it
    to the providers array here. Once the Data Access Service class is in place, we inject the built-in Angular Http
    Service so we can use it to communicate with the back-end server. We first import that service here along with
    several other classes we'll need later, then we inject the service in the constructor here. Now that the product
    service has itself an injected service, namely this Http Service, the Injectable decorator is now required.
    Angular's Http Service returns observables, so our next step is to import observable and the observable operators.
    Here we import Observable from the Reactive extensions, rxjs. We also import the operators we will use, do for
    debugging, catch and throw for error handling, and map to map the HTTP response to products. We'll see how to use
    these operators in the upcoming demos. The last step is to write the code to issue each HTTP request. We'll examine
    the code for each request shortly. But before we can issue an HTTP request to a back-end server, we need to have a
    back-end server, or at least fake one.</p>

<h3>Faking a Backend Server</h3>

<p>Before we can issue HTTP requests to a back-end server, we need to set up that back-end server. We select a
    technology such as Node, ASP.NET, PHP, Rails, or whatever, we set up a set of URLs for calling this server, those
    URLS define the API, or Application Programming Interface, and we build the server-side code to process requests
    sent to those URLs, and return appropriate responses. Our Data Access component then uses the defined API to issue
    HTTP requests, and processes the returned responses. But, what if we don't have a back-end server in place? Luckily,
    we can fake one. There are numerous ways to fake a back-end server. Our Data Access Service could simply return
    hardcoded data, this is a technique often used in demo applications; however, this technique does not use the
    Angular Http Service, and does not demonstrate how to issue requests to a back-end server, it won't do for our
    purposes. Another option is to use a JSON file. By setting the URL for the HTTP call to the location of a JSON file,
    we can use the Http Service to retrieve the data from the JSON file as if it were a back-end server. This works
    great if we only want to get data, but we also want to put and post data, so this technique is not sufficient.
    Angular provides a MockBackend class that we could use to write our own fake back-end server, but that sounds like a
    chore. An easier option is to use the in-memory Web API simulator called Angular in-memory-web-api. This simulator
    is not part of Angular core, but is a separate service developed and provided as part of the Angular documentation
    quick start files. Let's go with this last option. There are a few steps to set it up, let's take a look. To set up
    the Angular in-memory-web-api, we need to first ensure it is included in our package.json dependencies. We have it
    here, so it's installed when you run npm install, and we need to have it in our systemjs.config file, it is here.
    This tells the module loader where to find it. Then we need to add the in-memory-web-api to the imports array of one
    of our Angular modules. In this example, it is defined in the product.module because we are only using it for our
    product data. If we had multiple feature modules using it, we may want to move it from here to the core module or
    the app module. We define an import statement for it and its associated product data class here. We add it to the
    imports array here. In the imports array we call the forRoot method and pass the name of the ProductData class. The
    ProductData class provides the data managed by the in-memory-web-api. Let's take a look. This is the ProductData
    class, it implements InMemoryDbService, which specifies one required method, createDb. In this method we provide the
    data managed by the service. In our example, we create an array of products. One thing to note here, if you worked
    through the Acme Product Management application in the Angular 2: Getting Started course, you may notice that this
    data uses id instead of productId. Using id is required for the in-memory-web-api service to access the data by id,
    and assign new ids. The in-memory-web-api service then processes each HTTP request against this set of data. It
    retains all changes to this data in memory. If you stop the application and restart, the data is reinitialized to
    this array of products. When your real back-end server is set up, you can remove the InMemoryWebApiModule and the
    associated data class from the Angular module. Then the code in the Product Data Service will issue the HTTP
    requests to the actual server instead. With that, let's look at how to use the Http Service in our Product Data
    Service to retrieve data.</p>

<h3>Populating the Form with Data</h3>

<p>When working with forms, why do we need to get data from a back-end server? If it's a login form, or registration
    form, or other data collection type of form, you may not need to get data, just collect the user's entries and
    process them, but if it's an edit form, we want the current data so we can display it for edit. What if we already
    retrieved the data for a list or a selection style page? We may still want to re-get the data for the edit form from
    the back-end server to ensure we have the most current data before presenting it to the user for update. Whether any
    particular form in your application requires getting data from a back-end server depends largely on the purpose of
    the form, and volatility of its data. For the purposes of our example, the product edit form does indeed require
    current data, so we'll add code to populate the form from data obtained from the back-end server. Here is the code
    required to issue an HTTP get request using Angular's Http Service. The key bit of this code is the getProduct
    method. We want to retrieve a single product to edit, so we pass the ID of the desired product into this method.
    Here we use the backtick to define a template literal. This takes the base URL and appends a slash, followed by the
    defined id. The resulting URL looks something like this. The code then calls the get method of the Angular Http
    Service, and passes in the URL. Recall that the Http Service was injected into this service in the constructor here.
    At some future point in time when the response is returned, we map the data back into a product, and any subscribers
    are notified. How do we call this method and subscribe to this observable? In the forms component, in our case
    product-edit, we inject our Product Data Service using the constructor. Here we define a local getProduct method
    that calls the Product Data Service get method, passing in the id of the desired product to retrieve. We then call
    subscribe to subscribe to the observable returned by the getProduct method. By subscribing to the observable, this
    code is notified when the data is returned. When the observable does return the product, this code calls a method to
    process that product. If the observable returns an error, the error is cast to a type of any, and assigned to an
    errorMessage string. Let's examine this code in context.</p>

<h3>Populating the Form with Data: Demo</h3>

<p>In this demo, we look at how to retrieve data using HTTP, and use that data to populate the form. We start in the
    Product Data Service with the getProduct method to issue a get request and process the response. The get method here
    does a bit more work than the one shown in the slides. Recall from earlier in this course that our sample
    application's business rules use a product ID of 0 to indicate that the user wishes to add a new product, so if the
    ID is 0 the code assumes there is no product to retrieve, and instead returns a new initialized product. The
    initializedProduct method looks like this. Since the getProduct method returns an observable of IProduct, not a
    product directly, we create a new Observable, call next to return initializedProduct, and call complete to mark the
    subscription as complete. Observable.of provides a shortcut syntax for this set of code that you can use instead. As
    with many of these types of coding decisions, some may object to having a getProduct method return an
    initializedProduct. If so, you can delete this extra code here. The calling code would then decide whether to call
    getProduct to get an existing code, or call the initializeProduct method directly to get a newly initialized
    product. Note that often in real applications the back-end server is set up to return an existing item, or a new
    initialized item. That way the business rules for initialized item are defined at the server. If that is the case,
    this additional block of code is not needed. If the product's ID is not 0, the code builds up the appropriate URL
    using the passed in id. It then calls Angular's Http Service get method, as we saw in the slides. The code uses the
    map operator to map the responses to a product. We could inline that function here, but instead this code passes in
    a reusable function. The extractData function calls the JSON method, and returns an object literal containing the
    JSON data, or an empty object if there is no data. We could add other code here to modify or enhance this data
    before returning it. For example, we could alphabetize the search tags, or calculate the number of days since the
    product was released. This example also demonstrates the do operator, which specifies an action to take for each
    emitted observable. Here we simply log the data. This operator is great for debugging. We'll use do in each of our
    HTTP requests to see when the request occurs. Since we are using an in-memory Web API, we won't see our HTTP traffic
    in the Network tab, so logging to the console is a useful substitute. Note that this code is not executed until a
    caller subscribes. So let's look at that next. The ProductEditComponent needs the product data to display on the
    form for edit. It wants to use the Product Data Service to get the data, so it imports it here, and injects it using
    the constructor here. Next we need to decide the appropriate time to get the product data. Recall that the id of the
    product to edit is provided on the route as a parameter; we must read that value from the route before we can get
    the appropriate product. The code to read the route parameter is here in the ngOnInit, as discussed previously in
    this course. After we pull the id from the route, we call the local getProduct method, passing in that id. It is in
    this getProduct method that we use the Product Data Service. Here we call the Product Data Service getProduct
    method, passing in the id. We subscribe to the returned observable providing two callback functions. After the
    Product Data Service receives the response and maps it to a product, the subscribers are notified. If the product is
    retrieved successfully, the returned product is passed in, and this callback method is executed. This method calls
    onProductRetrieved to process it, otherwise this method sets the error message properly to display a message to the
    user. The onProductRetrieved method performs several operations. First, if the form was already in use, it resets
    it. This ensures that all of the state flags such as dirty, touched, and so on, are cleared before displaying the
    retrieved product. Then we set the product property to the retrieved product. This property holds our data model.
    Recall that we are not using data binding on the product, so this does not update the form with data. Next we set
    the appropriate title on the page based on the add or edit operation. This last bit of code here uses the product
    properties to set the value for each of the FormControls, the product data then appears on the form. We looked at
    setValue and patchValue earlier in this course. We use patchValue here and not setValue, so we can set the values
    for a subset of the FormControls on the form. This is required because our form model includes a FormArray, and we
    can't set the value of the FormArray with setValue. We then use setControl to reset the FormArray to the set of
    product tags. This ensures that the correct number of FormControls are created for this product's search tags. Let's
    check it out in the browser. Select Product List, select to edit the hammer, and the existing data is displayed for
    edit, including each of the three search tags. Let's edit something so we get a validation error. Now let's click
    the Add Product menu option. First we see our route guard warning us that we will lose our changes, click OK, and
    see the form reset, clearing our validation error. Notice also that our tags were reset to display only one
    initialized search tag. Use the techniques shown here anytime you need to retrieve data for display in a form, so
    the user can edit that data. Speaking of editing data, let's look at how to save those edits.</p>

<h3>Saving Edits</h3>

<p>An edit form is not really an edit form if we can't save the user's edits. We expect the user to make some changes to
    the data on the form, and then click the Save button, but what data do we save? That may seem like an odd question,
    because we of course want to save the user's changes, but when using Reactive forms, we have the data defined in two
    places. We have the user-entered values as shown in the form itself. As we saw earlier in this course, we can access
    that data using the value property of the form's root FormGroup, however, we also have the product property, which
    retains the original values we retrieved for display. Since we are not using ngModel for two-way data binding, these
    values are not automatically updated with the user's changes. Also notice that we have more fields in the product
    property than we do on the form, such as id, price, and imageUrl. If we update the back-end server with just the
    data from the form, we'll lose the values of those extra fields. We need to copy the user's changes over the
    original product properties. This may sound tedious, but is actually easy if we use the Object.assign method. This
    method takes in a target and any number of sources. Here our target is a new object, and our two sources are the
    product property and the form's root FormGroup value. Since later sources' properties overwrite earlier ones with
    the same key, our p variable now holds the original product properties overwriting any user's edits from the form.
    This is the data, then, that we'll save. We'll see this in action when we get to the demo shortly, but there's one
    other topic to cover first. When working with HTTP there are two different verbs we can use to save data, post and
    put. When do we use which? Post posts data for a resource or a set of resources without specifying an ID. It is used
    to create a new resource when the server assigns the ID, or update a set of resources. This URL is basically saying,
    I have some product data, process it. Put replaces data for a specific resource using a provided ID. It is used to
    create a new resource when the client assigns the ID, or update a resource with the defined ID. This URL is
    basically saying, I have a product with an ID of 5, replace that product if it exists, otherwise create it. One
    other important differentiator between post and put is that put is defined to be idempotent. This means that
    multiple put requests are expected to have no additional effect if called multiple times with the same parameters.
    Post is not idempotent. Issuing multiple post requests are not expected to have the same effect as one request.
    Bottom line, we will use post when creating a new product because we want the back-end server to have the
    responsibility of assigning appropriate IDs. We will use put when updating a product. We will explicitly set the ID
    of the product to update. Since we are talking now about saving edits to existing data, we'll start with the put.
    Here is another snippet from the Product Data Service. The key bit of this code is the updateProduct method. We want
    to update the data for our product, so we pass the updated product into this method. We then set the headers and
    options. In the headers object the Content-Type specifies that the body is in JSON format. We use this headers
    object to configure the options object. The RequestOptions allows us to specify request settings, such as the
    header. Here we use the backtick to define a template literal. This takes the baseUrl and appends a slash, followed
    by the defined id. The code then calls the put method of the Angular Http Service, and passes in the URL, the
    updated product, and the defined options object. At some future point in time, when the response is returned, we map
    the passed in product and any subscribers are notified. Note that if our back-end server was set up to return the
    updated product, we could use that here instead. Returning the updated product is useful if the server sets
    additional properties, such as the last update date. How do we call this updateProduct method? The
    product-edit.component calls the Product Data Service to save any edits. Here we define a local editProduct method
    that calls the Product Data Service updateProduct method, passing in the updated product. We then call subscribe to
    subscribe to the observable returned by the updateProduct method. By subscribing to the observable, this code is
    notified when the put operation completes. If the product is saved successfully, we call onSaveComplete for any
    final processing. In this example, we don't care about the returned product so we don't reference it here. If the
    observable returns an error, the error is cast to a type of any and assigned to an error message string. What type
    of code goes in to the onSaveComplete? That depends on the requirements of the application. Do you want to allow the
    user to save, but still stay on the same page? If so, then you may not want to do anything else there. Or do you
    want to navigate back to the list page after the save? Then you could add navigation code there. Let's examine the
    edit code in context.</p>

<h3>Saving Edits: Demo</h3>

<p>In this demo, we look at how to save user edits using HTTP. Again, we start with a Product Data Service. To minimize
    duplicate code between the put and the post, I added a saveProduct method. This method takes in the edited product,
    sets the header in options, as shown in the slide, and then performs the put or post based on the product ID. When
    editing an existing product, this calls the updateProduct method, passing the product and defined options. The
    updateProduct method then builds the appropriate URL. It calls the Angular Http Service put method to issue a put
    request and update the provided product. Notice we are again using the do operator to log our action to the console.
    The put request is not executed until a caller subscribes, so let's look at that next. When the user clicks the Save
    button and submits the form, the ngSubmit event handler calls the saveProduct method in the product-edit component.
    This saveProduct method first checks the form state, there's no point in saving the form data if it was not changed,
    as defined by the dirty property, or if it was not valid. If it was not dirty, clicking Save simply completes the
    save operation. If it was invalid, it stays on the Product Edit page. This line should look familiar from the
    slides. Here is where we create a new product object from the product data model property, overwriting any values
    from the form. This gives us all of the user's changes, plus any fields that were not included on the form, such as
    the ID. Then we call the saveProduct method on the Product Data Service, passing in the new product object we just
    created here. After the Product Data Service receives the response, the subscribers are notified. If the product is
    saved successfully, this callback is executed. This method calls onSaveComplete to perform any additional
    processing, otherwise this method sets the error message property to display a message to the user. The
    onSaveComplete method can perform any operations required after the product is saved. In this example, it navigates
    to the Product List page. Notice that we call Reset on the form before navigating away, this is because the form is
    still marked as dirty. If we don't reset the form, our route guard will tell us the form has unsaved changes. Now
    let's see the edit operation in action in the browser. Here is our edit form, we can update any values. When the
    form is valid we click Save to save those changes, and the navigation takes us back to the Product List page. We can
    see our edit here. So that's how we save user changes, but what if the user creates a new product? How do we handle
    that?</p>

<h3>Creating New Items</h3>

<p>At first glance, creating a new item sounds easy, just put up an empty form, and save the user's entries with the
    same save method as for and edit, but there is more to it than that. Often we want to start with a properly
    initialized object, and when we save a new item we want to call post instead of put. We'll look at post in a moment,
    but why do we need a properly initialized object and not just an empty form? This looks like an empty form. There
    are several reasons we may want to start with an initialized object instead of just an empty form. We can initialize
    arrays and other data structures so they are easier to work with. In this example, the tags array is initialized to
    an empty array, so we can easily push items to it without worrying about the array being undefined. We can set
    proper defaults, the business rules for this app define that a new product has an id of 0, so we can set that here.
    We could also set defaults for the releaseDate, or any other fields that make sense. So the next question is where,
    where should we initialize this product? As we discussed earlier, one good choice is the back-end server. We could
    put the logic for defining a properly initialized object in the back-end server's code. When it receives the get
    request for an id of 0, it could return an initialized product. This is a good option to keep all of that logic in
    the back-end server, however, our in-memory Web API service does not know how to do that, and there may be cases
    that we don't want our back-end server to handle initializing our objects. In these scenarios we initialize the
    object in the Data Access Service with code like this. The code to post request is similar to the code to put a
    request, except that we don't pass an ID. We set up the same headers and options. Instead of passing in an URL that
    contains the product ID, we just use the baseUrl. We still pass the product and options, we then map the response to
    a product, and notify the subscribers passing along the newly saved product. This product includes any changes made
    by the back-end server, such as assigning the unique ID. We call this method similar to how we call the method to
    edit existing data. Let's look at this code in the context of our sample application.</p>

<h3>Creating New Items: Demo</h3>

<p>In this demo, we look at how to create new items by issuing an HTTP post request. When the user clicks the Save
    button and submits the form, the ngSubmit event handler calls the saveProduct method in the product-edit.component.
    That method doesn't care if the product is new and requires a post, or is an update and requires a put, it just
    ensures that it has the updated data using the Object.assign technique we discussed earlier. Here product is the
    newly initialized product object, and productForm.value provides the user entered values. It then calls the Product
    Data Service saveProduct method, passing in the product to save. We looked at the saveProduct method earlier, this
    code sets up the headers and options, and calls the appropriate routine based on the product id. If we are creating
    a new product, specified with a product.id of 0, it calls the createProduct method to issue a post request. The code
    in the createProduct method looks very similar to the code in the slide, however, it first sets the product.id to
    undefined. This is for the in-memory Web API service we are using to fake our back-end server. For it to assign a
    unique id to each created item, we must specify an id of undefined, then this method calls Angular's Http Service
    post method, and posts the product and defined options to the specified URL. When the request is processed and the
    response is returned, this code maps the response object back to a product object, the subscribers are then
    notified, and pass this product. Notice that we are again using the do operator to log our action to the console. In
    our example, the subscriber ignores the returned object because it does not need it. It won't stay on this page,
    instead it navigates back to the Product List page, just as with the edit operation. Let's try it out in the
    browser. We click on the Add Product menu option to create a new product. The product edit form is displayed with an
    initialized product. We can enter any data, and click Save. We are returned to the Product List page with our new
    product here. Click to Edit the product, and we see the assigned ID and the URL. Next, let's look at a delete.</p>

<h3>Deleting an Existing Item</h3>

<p>In our sample application, a user can delete an existing item using the Delete button at the bottom of the form. We
    could have instead added a Delete button to the Product List page next to the Edit buttons here. So the ability to
    delete is not really tied to using a form, it is included in this course for completeness. The biggest question to
    consider when providing delete functionality is whether to really delete? In most of the applications I've written,
    the delete option does not really delete data, rather it sets a status field in the data to deleted, that way the
    data is never gone, it is still available for history, reporting, and that emergency request to undelete an
    accidental deletion. When marking an item as deleted using a status field in the data, we issue a put or patch
    request to update the status field similar to how we perform an edit operation, we do not issue an HTTP delete
    request. In this clip, however, we'll assume that we really, really, really need to delete the data, and we'll see
    how to issue an HTTP delete request. Here is a snippet from the Product Data Service. The deleteProduct method takes
    in the id of the product to delete, it does not need the entire product. Notice that it returns an Observable of
    Response, not an Observable of Product. This method then defines the headers and options similar to the HTTP put and
    post, and uses the passed in id to build a URL that specifies the item to delete. We then call the Angular Http
    Service delete method, passing along the URL and defined options. Since we don't expect to get back a product, we
    don't need a map operator here. The product-edit.component calls the Product Data Service to perform the delete
    operation. Here we define a local deleteProduct method that calls the injected Product Data Service deleteProduct
    method, passing in the id of the product to delete. We then subscribe to the observable returned by the
    deleteProduct method. By subscribing to the observable, this code is notified when the delete operation completes.
    When the response is returned, we proceed as with the save. Let's look at this in the context of our sample
    application.</p>

<h3>Deleting an Existing Item: Demo</h3>

<p>In this demo, we look at how to delete existing items. When the user clicks the Delete button on the form, the click
    event handler calls the deleteProduct method in the product-edit.component. The deleteProduct method here is a bit
    more complex than that shown in the slide. First we check the product.id. If the user selected to add a product and
    clicked the Delete button before that new product was saved, we don't need to issue a delete request to the back-end
    server, we can just not save it. This code simply resets the form, and navigates back to the Product List page. If
    the product id is not 0, the code displays a dialog asking the user to confirm the delete operation. For a real app,
    you may want to consider displaying something nicer, but this works for our purposes. If the user confirms the
    delete operation, we call the Product Data Service deleteProduct method, passing in the id of the product to delete.
    In the Product Data Service, the deleteProduct method first sets the headers and options similar to the code for the
    save operations, and builds a URL that includes the id of the product to delete. It then calls Angular's Http
    Service delete method, passing along the URL and options. Here again is the do operator, so we can track when the
    delete operation occurs, and some exception handling. Now let's try it out in the browser. Let's start with a
    scenario whereby the user deletes a newly added item without saving first. Before we begin, let's open the developer
    tools, and clear the console. Recall that we won't see the HTTP requests in the Network tab since this application
    uses an in-memory Web API. To see when each request occurs, the code includes the do operator, and logs to the
    console for each HTTP request. We click Add Product, and notice there was no get request to get the data for
    display, instead the Product Data Service returned an initialized product. We can enter some data, and then click
    Delete. If we scroll up in the console, we see no delete request, all we see is the getProducts request used to
    display this page. Now let's try deleting an existing product. Let's clear the console, and click Edit to edit the
    hammer. Scrolling up, we can see that we issued a get request to get the current product data for display. Then
    click the Delete button. Here we see the delete confirmation message, click OK, and the product is deleted. We can
    see the delete request here. With that, we have a Data Access Service that supports CRUD, create using post, read
    using get, update using put, and delete using delete. Now let's finish up this module with some checklists we can
    use when our forms communicate with a back-end server.</p>

<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>

<p>Before we can use Angular's HTTP Client Service, we need to register it with an Angular injector. This registration
    is done for us in the HttpModule included in the Angular HTTP package. We pull HttpModule into our application by
    adding HttpModule to the imports array of one of our application's Angular Modules, then build the Data Access
    Service to wrap the HTTP requests. Specify the needed imports. Define a dependency for the Angular Http Client
    Service using a constructor parameter. Create a method for each HTTP request. In each method call the desired HTTP
    method, such as get, and pass in the URL to the desired server, along with any other required arguments. Use the map
    operator to transform the raw HTTP response to a JSON object, and add error handling as desired. In any component
    that needs data from a data service, including any forms, such as our product-edit.component, inject the Data Access
    Service in the constructor. Then for each Data Access Service method call, such as getProduct, subscribe to the
    returned observable. Provide a function to execute when the observable emits an item, and add an error function to
    handle any returned errors. Use similar code for each Data Access Service operation your form needs. This module was
    all about data access. We examined a sample Data Access Service that uses Angular's Http Service to communicate with
    a back-end server. We faked that back-end server with an in-memory Web API so the application could demonstrate the
    appropriate code, yet not require setup of an actual back-end server. We saw how to initialize an object and call
    the post method to create new items. We examined how to retrieve existing items with the get method. We saved the
    user's updates with the put method. And, even though we may want to save a status code that marks an item as deleted
    instead, we walked through the code required to directly delete an item with the delete method. Only one module
    left.</p>
