<h2>Validation</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>If only our users never made a mistake, never missed a required field, and always knew the constraints for each input
    element, we would not need validation, but I don't think we can make that assumption. Welcome back to Angular 2:
    Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module we look at form validation, the
    Reactive way. The template-driven technique for validating form data is to specify appropriate validation attributes
    in the HTML. These validation rules determine if the user's entry is right or wrong, but what if it depends? What if
    we want to adjust the validation logic based on the user or on the state of the application? For example, we could
    perform different validation for administrators giving them more flexibility than normal users. Or we could validate
    differently based on the user's selection. If the user selects notification by text, phone is required, if by email,
    the email address is required. With Reactive forms we have much more control and can handle validation rules that
    specify right, wrong, or it depends. In this module, we examine how to set built-in validation rules in the
    component class, such as required and max length. We look at how to adjust those rules at runtime, based on desired
    criteria. We build a custom validator for the ultimate in validation flexibility. We expand our custom validator by
    passing in parameters, that way we can make our custom validator more generalized and reusable, but sometimes it's
    not enough to validate a single input element. We'll cover cross-field validation, and see how to validate a set of
    input elements as a group. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Setting Built-in Validation Rules</h3>

<p>We've seen how to use the FormBuilder to create the root FormGroup, by specifying a FormControl with a default value
    for each of our input elements. Let's examine how to specify the validation rules here as well. Recall from the last
    module that we have three choices of syntax when defining a FormControl. We define a key value pair, where the key
    is the FormControl name and the value is the default input element value, such as an empty string or true in this
    example, or we can provide a key value pair where the value is an object with a value and disabled state. Or we
    define the FormControl's key value pair, where the value is an array. The first element of the array is the default
    input element value, the array syntax is the one we use to set validation rules for the FormControl. We set the
    validation rules in the second element of the array. For built-in validators we use the Validators class, and
    specify the name of the desired validation rule. In this example, we set the required validator. To specify multiple
    validation rules for a FormControl, use an array. In this example, we set the required validator and the minLength
    validator, passing in a 3 to specify a minimum length of 3 characters. So the first element of the array is the
    default value, and the second element to the array is an array of validation rules. The third element to the array,
    which is not shown here, is for any asynchronous validators. An asynchronous validator, as its name suggests, is for
    asynchronous validation operations. The most common use of asynchronous validation is calling a server-side
    validation method. To minimize the asynchronous calls, asynchronous validators are not executed until all
    synchronous validators pass validation. Notice that we can mix and match these styles. The firstName control uses an
    array because it has a validator. The sendCatalog FormControl specifies a simple default value because it needs no
    validator, so we can use the appropriate FormControl syntax for the requirements of each FormControl. Now let's set
    up some built-in validators. Looking at the HTML we can see that the First Name input element has two validation
    attributes, required and a minlength of 3. Let's delete these validation rules from the HTML. Now let's add them to
    the component class. Angular forms provides a validators class that has the basic validators built in. We import
    Validators from angular/forms to access those basic validators. We want to add validators to our firstName
    FormControl here, so we change the single value to an array. The first element of the array is our default value,
    the second element is for our validators. We can specify a single validator or an array of validators. In this
    example, we need both required and minlength, so we'll define an array of validators. We set Validators.required to
    mark the input element as required, and Validators.minLength, passing in a 3, to require a minimum length of 3
    characters. Let's check it out in the browser. Set focus into the First Name, click out, and we see our required
    validation message. Now let's repeat this process for each of our other input elements. In the HTML, the Last Name
    has required and maxlength, let's delete these here and add them to our FormControl here. We change this single
    value to an array, then add the validators, Validators.required, Validators.maxLength 50. In the HTML the email has
    required and pattern, let's copy our pattern before we delete it, and add them to to our FormControl here, passing
    in the desired pattern. Our sendCatalog binds to a checkbox, so no validation is required. Let's check out the
    browser and see if all of our validation still works. First Name, yes, Last Name, yep, Email, you betcha. Our
    validation is now in our class. That was pretty easy, but how do we change that validation based on some criteria,
    such as a user selection?</p>

<h3>Adjusting Validation Rules at Runtime</h3>

<p>One of the benefits of using the Reactive forms approach is the ability to easily adjust validation rules at runtime.
    For example, we want administrative or internal users to have fewer required fields, we want different validation
    when creating data versus an update, or we need the validation to change based on another selection on the form. In
    this example, if the user selects to receive notification by text, then the phone field is required, otherwise the
    phone is optional. We change the validation for any FormControl at runtime by calling the setValidators method on
    that FormControl instance, and pass in the new validator. We can pass in a single validator or an array of
    validators. Here we change the validation to required and a maxLength of 30. We can remove all validators from a
    control calling clearValidators, this comes in handy if we want to add validation rules under some circumstances,
    and remove those rules under other conditions. However, updating the validators doesn't cause the validation status
    of the control to be reevaluated, so when we change the validators, if we want the control validation to be
    reevaluated based on the new validation rules, we need to call updateValueAndValidity on that FormControl as well.
    Let's jump back to the demo and give this a try. Since we last saw the demo application, I've added several input
    elements in the HTML. The Marketing Department wanted us to add a phone number, so I did that here, and set the
    formControlName directive to phone. We'll add phone to our FormBuilder in a moment. And the Marketing Department
    wanted radio buttons to set up notifications. The user can select to get notified via email or text. Notice that
    their values are email and text here. I've set the formControlName directive for each of the radio buttons to the
    same formControlName called notification; that allows us to track the radio buttons as one value. Now I need to add
    the FormControls for these input elements in the component class. We add phone for the phone input element, and we
    add notification for the set of radio buttons. Let's set the default value for the notification to email, that means
    initially the phone number input element is optional, and we don't need to define validation rules here. Since the
    user must pick one of the radio buttons, we don't need validation for notification either, but what if the user
    selects notification by text? We need to change the phone number validation to required. How are we going to do
    that? How about trying out setValidators? The first question we need to ask ourselves is where should we put the
    code that sets the validators? Well, what do we want it to do exactly? When the user clicks the email radio button,
    the phone number becomes optional, when the user clicks the text radio button, the phone number becomes required. So
    let's add a method that will call when either radio button is clicked. We'll call it setNotification, it takes in a
    string defining which radio button was clicked, and it returns a void. In the HTML, we use event binding on the
    click event for each radio button to call this setNotification method, passing in the appropriate text. Going back
    to the component class, in this setNotification method we use setValidators to change the validation of the phone
    input element appropriately. I'll paste the code, and we can talk through it. We first need a reference to the phone
    FormControl, remember from the last module how we do that? One way is to use the root FormGroup's get method to find
    the phone's FormControl within the form model. If the notification is via text, then we add the required validator
    for the phone FormControl by calling the setValidators method. We can pass in a single validator or an array of
    validators. In this example we only need one, required, otherwise we clear the validators for the phone FormControl.
    There is one more line of code we need here, after setting or clearing the validators, we need to reevaluate the
    phone FormControls validation state, so we call updateValueAndValidity. Let's check it out in the browser. We'll
    fill out the required fields so everything is valid. Now we see the Save button as enabled, and Valid is true. If we
    click the Text radio button, we see the phone validation error message, and the Save button is disabled. If we check
    email, the phone is no longer required, the validation message goes away, and the Save button is enabled. We now
    have a validation rule that adjusts itself at runtime. We can use setValidators, clearValidators, and the
    all-important updateValueAndValidity anytime we need to change the validation on the fly. Next, let's look at
    defining custom validation rules.</p>

<h3>Custom Validators</h3>

<p>Angular only provides basic validators, such as requiredMaxLength and pattern. Though we can do a lot with pattern,
    there are times we need custom validation rules. We define a custom validation rule with a custom validator. In its
    simplest form, a validator is a function. The validator function always takes one parameter, the FormControl or
    FormGroup being validated. To allow passing in either a FormControl or a FormGroup, we type the parameter using the
    abstract class, AbstractControl. This part of the syntax defines the type of value returned from this function. It
    looks a bit gnarly, so let's break it down. The validator function returns an object defining the broken rule, or
    null if it is valid. The returned object is comprised of a key and value pair, where the key is a string and the
    value is a Boolean. In the custom validator function we perform whatever logic we desire. If our logic determines
    that the validation rule passes, we return a null, if the validation rule fails, we return an object. The key is a
    string and defines the name of the broken validation rule. The value is set to true to indicate that the current
    entry has an error. The broken validation rule is then added to the passed in FormControl or FormGroup error
    collection. Let's build a custom validator. Someone in Marketing had this great idea to add a rate your experience
    element to the form. At some future point this will have a fancy user interface, such as selecting stars, but for
    now they want a simple text box where the user can enter 1 through 5. I've already added the requested rating input
    element here, and set the formControlName directive to rating. Let's add the FormControl for the rating to the form
    model, we'll use an empty string for the default value. We could add a pattern validator here to check a range of
    values, but to try out custom validation let's create our own numeric range validator. We can add our validator
    function above our component class. If this validator will only be used by this component, it makes sense to add it
    here, but if the validator could be used by other parts of the application, consider instead putting it in its own
    file. It can then more easily be reused by any component that needs it with a simple import statement. We'll see how
    to make a validator reusable later in this course. Let's call our validator function ratingRange. I'll paste the
    code, and we can walk through it. As discussed on the slides, a validator function always takes one parameter, the
    FormControl or FormGroup being validated. To allow either a FormControl or FormGroup, we specify AbstractControl
    here, and we need to import it from angular/forms. Next we define the return type of this function. A validator
    function always returns a key and value pair defining the broken validation rule, or a null if it is valid. We
    define our custom validation logic in the body of the validator function. For this specific example, we check if the
    control has a value that is not defined, is not a number, is less than 1, or greater than 5. If so we return the key
    and value pair specifying the name of the validation rule, we'll call it range, and true to indicate that the
    validation rule was broken. The validation rule name is then added to the errors collection for the passed in
    FormControl. If the control is valid, we return null. To set our new validator, we simple add it to the FormControl
    just like the built-in validators. We change the rating FormControl from a single value to an array, and pass the
    name of the validator function, ratingRange in our example, as the second parameter. Notice that we set the
    validation rule name here as range. In the HTML, if we want to display an error message for this particular
    validator we use the validation rule name, I've already done that here. Now let's see how it works in the browser.
    Here's our new Rating field, let's put in a 7, and we see our validation message. Change it to 4, and all is well.
    Adding custom validation is as easy as writing a function, the only odd part is ensuring the appropriate return
    value. Null if the FormControl is valid, a key and value pair if it is invalid, where the key is the name of the
    validation rule, and the value is true to add it to the list of validation errors. But notice that we hardcoded in
    the range here, what if we wanted to make this more generalized to work with a provided range of numbers?</p>

<h3>Custom Validation with Parameters</h3>

<p>The validator function we wrote works well for any simple validation, but what if we need parameters? For example, we
    want to limit entry to a provided range of values, we can't just add more parameters here. To define a custom
    validator with parameters, we need a more complex function that returns a validator function. Wait, what? Let's talk
    through this code. Because a validator function can only take one parameter, the AbstractControl to validate, we
    can't simply pass more parameters to this function, instead we build a factory function that returns the validator
    function. Here we have our factory function, we can specify any number and type of parameters here. This factor
    function returns a validator function, so we define ValidatorFn as the return type, and return our validator
    function. This is the same validator function that we saw on the prior slide, but instead of declaring and naming
    this function, we simple return it using the arrow function syntax. Let's give this a try. We want to change our
    ratingRange validator to take in a minimum acceptable value and a maximum acceptable value, so this validator can be
    used for ranges other than one that is hardcoded in. Currently we hardcoded in a range between 1 and 5. As we saw in
    the slide, we can't simply pass more parameters to this validator function. Rather, we need to wrap this function in
    a factory function, like this. The function takes in the minimum acceptable value, and the maximum acceptable value,
    and returns a validator function. Oh, and we need to add ValidatorFn to the import statement, then we return our
    validator function by changing it to an arrow function, we add the return statement, we remove function and the
    function name, and we add an arrow here to define the returned validator function. Next, we modify the logic of the
    validator function to use the passed in parameters. We'll change the 1 here to min, and the 5 to max. Now we can
    change the FormControl validation to pass in the minimum and maximum values. Does it still work? Try a 7, error, 5,
    it's good, 0, another error, 2, it's good, it works. Modifying a validator function to accept parameters requires
    wrapping the validator function in a factory function. That factory function takes in any desired parameters, and
    returns the validator function. Then we modify the validator function to use those provided parameters, but what if
    we need to validate across multiple FormControls?</p>

<h3>Cross-Field Validation: Nested FormGroup</h3>

<p>Sometimes, simple FormControl validation is not enough, we need to compare across two or more form controls. A common
    example of this is to compare a start date and end date to ensure the start date is before the end date, or to
    confirm entry of a password or email address. The trick to cross-field validation is to define a nested FormGroup
    for the FormControls that are validated together. We define them as a FormGroup both in the component and in the
    HTML. In the component class, we define a nested group within the forms root FormGroup. In this example, we name
    this nested group availability. To create a nested group we use the same syntax as when we create the forms root
    FormGroup. We call the group method of the FormBuilder, any FormControl to be validated as part of the group is then
    defined within this nested FormGroup. In our example, we have two FormControls, but there could be any number of
    FormControls, or more nested FormGroups defined in this group. We set each FormControls default value and validation
    as we have throughout this module. In the HTML we define a container element, such as this div element, to enclose
    the input elements associated with the FormGroup, and then use the formGroupName directive to associate the
    container element with our nested FormGroup. The input elements within the container use the formControlName
    directive assigned to the name of the FormControl within the nested FormGroup. Once we have the grouping in place,
    we can perform the cross-field validation, but let's take it one step at a time, and add the nested FormGroup first.
    The Marketing Department has gotten too many returned emails, and believe it is because the user has mistyped their
    email address in the form, so they've requested that we add an email confirmation text box. This may not be the
    greatest idea, but it provides a simple example of cross-field validation. I've already added the confirm email
    input element, it looks similar to the email input element. Here the formControlName directive is set to
    confirmEmail. Now let's add the FormControl for this Confirm Email input element to the form model in our component
    class. We add confirmEmail, we don't need a default value, and we specify the required validator. We could also
    specify the pattern validator here, but if we are comparing it against the email FormControl, which already has the
    pattern validator, we don't really need it here. Recall from the slides that the first step to making the
    cross-field validation is to create a nested FormGroup for the form controls to validate as a group. Let's name that
    group emailGroup, and create the nested group by calling the group method of the FormBuilder. We can then copy our
    two email form controls into that nested form group and reformat. The resulting form model has a root FormGroup here
    and the nested FormGroup here. Now let's group the HTML as well. First we define an element that surrounds the input
    elements to validate as a group. We'll specify a div element and reformat. Note that the form-group here is just a
    Bootstrap style class, and does not affect our form model. We then use the formGroupName directive and set it to the
    name of our FormGroup, which is emailGroup. Now that the FormControls are within a nested FormGroup, we need to
    change each reference to the FormControl. We could use customerForm.controls.emailGroup.controls.email to drill down
    from the form to the FormGroup to the control, but here is where the FormGroup's get method can simplify our syntax.
    We make this change everywhere we are referring to this control; we make a similar change for the confirmEmail.
    Let's view the result in the browser. Here's our new Confirm Email input element, our required field validation
    works for the Email and for the Confirm Email. Notice I've misspelled the second email address, and we're not
    getting an error message on the cross-field validation. That's because we haven't written it yet. Notice that our
    Value property here at the bottom now shows our nested group. Great, let's move on to building the cross-field
    validator.</p>

<h3>Cross-field Validation: Custom Validator</h3>

<p>Now that we've defined our set of FormControls as a FormGroup, we could build a validator function similar to the one
    we built earlier in this module. If the validation does not require parameters, we can build a simple validator
    function, otherwise we can build a factory function that returns a validator function. In either case, we are
    validating the nested FormGroup, so that FormGroup is passed in to this method. To validate the contents of the
    multiple FormControls, we first access the FormControls from the passed in FormGroup using the get method. In this
    example, we get the FormControl named start, and the FormControl named end. We then compare their values as needed,
    and return null if the validation rules passes, or a validation error object if the validation fails. Then we add
    the validator to the FormGroup. Note that we can't simply add the validator function here, the FormGroup signature
    requires that we provide an object with a validator key and the function as the value. Let's see cross-field
    validation in action. We'll create the validator function here, I'll just paste it in, and we can talk through it.
    The function is called emailMatcher. We don't need any extra parameters, so we just use the simple validator
    function. The parameter here will be a passed in FormGroup. We call the get method of the FormGroup to find both the
    email and confirmEmail FormControls. We then use these references to check the value of the email FormControl
    against the value of the confirmEmail FormControl. If the values match, we return null. If the values don't match,
    we return a key and value pair, where the key is the name of the validation rule and the value is true to add this
    rule to the errors collection for the FormGroup. Let me say that again. This adds the broken validation rule name to
    the errors collection for the FormGroup, not the individual FormControls. And because we don't want the validation
    to return an error until the user has touched the fields, let's add one more condition to our validator function. If
    either the email FormControl or the confirmEmail FormControl has not yet been touched, return null, and skip the
    validation. Next, we add this validator to the nested FormGroup as the second argument. Recall from the slides that
    we can't simply add the validator function here, instead we pass an object with a validator property. To let the
    user know that there's a problem, let's add a style class to the group in the HTML. Here we set the style using the
    Bootstrap has-error class, if the emailGroup has any errors defined in its errors collection. Let's check it out in
    the browser. We type in an email address, and the Confirm Email does not yet turn red. As soon as we type anything
    into the confirmation element, both fields turn red because they don't match. When we type in a matching email
    address, the has-error style is removed, and the elements are no longer red. But just turning elements red is not
    very user friendly, let's add a validation message for the user. Let's put the validation message on the Confirm
    Email element. Our first thought might be to add something like this. The problem is, however, that the FormControl
    doesn't get a match entry in its errors collection, rather the match error appears in the errors collection for the
    FormGroup. We instead need to change this to check the emailGroup's errors collection. If we tried it at this point,
    it still wouldn't display the message because of this ngIf block here. This ngIf checks the confirmEmail FormControl
    and its errors collection. We need to add another or expression, and add another parenthesis here. Now these span
    elements are displayed if either the confirmEmail or the emailGroup errors collection has a value. This leads us to
    another problem. Because we are now displaying these spans when the nested FormGroup has an error, not necessarily
    when the Confirm Email has an error, we need to add the safe navigation operator here and here. This prevents the
    cannot read property required of null type of error. As you can see, the checks here for displaying the error
    messages are getting even more messy. We'll refactor this code, pushing much of this logic into the component class
    later in this course. For now, let's check this out in the browser. We'll put in an email address and start entering
    the confirmation email, we see the message that they don't match. As soon as it does match our error message
    disappears, it works, yeah. To implement cross-field validation, we create a nested FormGroup, and add the
    FormControls to be validated to that nested group. We then set the formGroupName directive on an HTML element that
    encapsulates the associated input elements. We wrote the validator function, and specified that validator when
    creating the nested FormGroup. Let's finish this module with some checklists we can use as we add validation to our
    applications.</p>

<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>

<p>When setting any of the built-in validation rules for FormControl, start by adding an import statement for
    validators, then pass the validator or array of validators as the second element in the value for the FormControl.
    In this example, we pass a single validator for the firstName, and an array of validators for the lastName. To
    adjust the validation rules at runtime based on some criteria, first determine when to make the change. If it is
    based on user action, tie it to that user action. Next, we call the FormControl's setValidators method, and pass in
    the validator, or an array of validators, or we can clear all validators with clearValidators, like this. And always
    remember to call the FormControl's updateValueAndValidity. Calling setValidators or clearValidators does not trigger
    any update or value changed events, so the validation is not reevaluated. Call updateValueAndValidity to trigger the
    validation. Any time we need specialized rules for validating a FormControl, we build a custom validator. A custom
    validator is simply a function that takes in the control to validate and returns a null if the control is valid, or
    a validation error object, like this. The validation error object is a key and value pair, where the key is the name
    of the validation rule, and the value is true. This key is used as the name of the broken validation rule when it
    appears in the errors collection for the FormControl. We then use our custom validator just like any other
    validator, like so. Here the firstName FormControl is validated with our custom validator. It is important to note
    that we can also use any custom validators with the template-driven forms approach. We just need to expose our
    custom validator function as a directive, then the directive can be applied to the HTML elements, just like the
    built-in attributes such as required and max length. If we need to pass parameters to our custom validator function,
    we wrap it in a factory function, like this. We specify the desired parameters here, and return a validator function
    using the arrow function syntax. We then use the custom validator just like any other validator that has parameters,
    like this. When we need to validate across two or more FormControls, we group the controls to validate in a nested
    FormGroup. We start by defining a nested FormGroup, and adding the FormControls to validate to that group, as so.
    Even though we are showing two FormControls here, any number of FormControls or other nested FormGroups could belong
    to this nested FormControl. We then update the HTML. We define a container element around the controls to validate.
    We use the formGroupName directive and assign it to the nested formGroupName. Once we have the FormControls to
    validate within a nested FormGroup, we build the custom validator. We can build a validator function without
    parameters as shown here, or with parameters using a factory function, as shown previously. Either way, we then use
    the validator like this. When adding validators to a FormGroup, we provide it as an object with a key and value
    pair. The key is validator and the value is the validator function. In this module, we focused on validation. We
    began by working with the built-in validators, and saw how to define one or more validators for each FormControl.
    Next, we looked at how to adjust the validation rules at runtime based on desired criteria. We then examined how to
    perform custom validation by building a validator function. We created a function to validate a numeric value to
    ensure it fell within a hardcoded range of values. We expanded on our custom validator by adding parameters, this
    allows any FormControl that uses our custom validator to define the desired range of values. Lastly, we saw how to
    validate several fields as a group. Next up, let's see how to listen for changes on the form and react
    accordingly.</p>
