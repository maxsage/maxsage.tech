<h2>Template-driven vs. Reactive Forms</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>To determine whether Reactive forms is the right choice for your project and your team, it is important to understand
    your form options. Welcome back to Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in
    this module we lay the foundation for understanding Reactive forms by looking at the similarities and differences
    between it and template-driven forms. Coffee or tea? Cash or credit? Paper or plastic? Right or left? We face many
    choices every day, and when it comes to building forms in Angular, our choice is whether to use a template-driven or
    Reactive forms approach. In this module, we start with the Angular form building blocks used by both approaches,
    FormGroup and FormControl. We see what they are, and what they do. Next, we walk through the template syntax for
    both template-driven and Reactive forms. Then we examine a simple template-driven form. Our focus is not on all the
    features of Template-driven forms, but rather on understanding enough to compare it clearly with Reactive forms.
    Lastly, we look at several complex form processing scenarios as a segue to Reactive forms. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>Form Building Blocks</h3>

<p>One of the key uses of forms is for the user to enter data that we save somewhere. Say that we display a form to the
    user, like this form. We don't want to save data that is incomplete or invalid, so we validate the user's entries as
    needed. If the entered information is not valid, we indicate that to the user and display an appropriate validation
    error message. There are many ways to style invalid entries and display the validation message, this is the simple
    technique we will use. We also want to disable the Save button until the input elements contain valid data. To
    achieve all of this, we track the state of each input element and the state of the form itself. Angular has a set of
    predefined form and input element states. These states define whether the user has changed a value in an input
    element. If the value is unchanged, the state of the input element is pristine. Changed values have a state of
    dirty. If all input elements on a form are pristine, then the form itself is pristine. If any input element on the
    form is dirty, then the form state is dirty. A state and an array track validity. The input element state is valid
    if it passes all defined validation rules. The form itself is valid if all input elements on the form are valid.
    Validation errors are added to an errors collection. The key of each array element is the name of the validation
    rule associated with the error. These states define whether the user has visited an input element. A value of
    touched means the user has set focus into the input element, and then left the input element. Untouched is set if
    the user has not set focus, then left the input element. A form is touched if any input element has been touched.
    These visited states are useful to prevent displaying the required validation error message until the user has had a
    chance to enter something. How do we track all of this state information? Luckily for us, Angular has building
    blocks that define a form model, which tracks all of this state, plus the value of each input element. These
    building blocks are used by both template-driven and Reactive forms to track state and values. FormControl tracks
    the value and state of an individual input element, such as an input box. FormGroup tracks the value and state of a
    group of form controls. A form itself is managed as a form group, because what is a form but a group of input
    elements whose state and value we wish to track together. But any group of input elements on a form can comprise a
    FormGroup, we could group the input elements for a mailing address block, for example. And FormGroups themselves can
    be nested within other FormGroups. For clarity, I'll often refer to the forms FormGroup as the root FormGroup. These
    building blocks are actually classes provided when we work with Angular forms. Instances of these classes define the
    form model. I've mentioned the term form model several times now. What is a form model exactly? A form model is the
    data structure that represents the HTML form, and it looks like this. The structure of the form model reflects the
    form and input elements in the template. In most cases, each input element within the HTML form has a corresponding
    form control in the form model. The form model retains form state, such as dirty or valid. It retains the user's
    entries and its value property. As the user types into any input element on the form, the value property is changed
    accordingly. The form model also tracks all of the FormControls and nested FormGroups within the form, along with
    their state and value. Don't confuse the form model with the data model that we use with data binding. We'll see
    both the data model and form model when we get to the demo. We use these properties from the form model anytime we
    need to know the state or value of a FormControl or FormGroup. This form model is the same for both template-driven
    and Reactive forms, but how it is created is different. When using a template-driven approach we write HTML in our
    template for the form element, each input element, data binding, validation rules using attributes, and validation
    error messages. Angular automatically generates the associated form model, we can then use the form model as needed.
    In our component class, we define properties for the data binding. These properties represent our data model. We
    also implement methods for form operations, such as getting the data for display on the form, and saving that data
    on a submit. Two-way data binding is a key part of template-driven forms, as it keeps all of the data on the form in
    synchronization with properties in the component class. Reactive forms shift the responsibility for creating the
    form model to the component class. We define the form model by creating the instances of the FormGroup and
    FormControl building blocks in our component class. We define the validation rules in the class. We can even handle
    display of validation error messages in the class. We manage the data for the form in the class, no data binding in
    the HTML. And the class provides methods for form processing, such as handling the submit. We still define the
    visual parts of the form in the template, so we create the form element and input elements in the template. We then
    bind these input elements to the form model defined in the component class. So instead of binding the input elements
    to the data model properties directly, we bind to the form model we build in our component class.</p>

<h3>Form Directives</h3>

<p>Template-driven and Reactive forms use entirely different sets of directives for binding the FormControl and
    FormGroup building blocks to the form and input elements in the template. When using template-driven forms, we first
    import the forms module to bring in the appropriate set of directives. This includes ngForm to access the form model
    Angular generates for us, ngModel for two-way binding, and to access the input element state defined in the
    generated form model, and ngModelGroup for grouping input elements within the form. When we add a form element to
    our template, Angular automatically assigns the ngForm directive to that form. Angular creates the form model
    starting with the root FormGroup instance, and automatically binds it to the form to track the form value and state.
    We never have to apply the ngForm directive ourselves. If we want to access the form model state information in our
    template, we export the ngForm directive into a template reference variable like this. Here we use a hash to define
    a template reference variable called signupForm, and set it equal to ngForm, this variable then references the
    form's root FormGroup instance. Anytime we want to access the form model, we use this template reference variable.
    In this example, we check the valid property of the FormGroup instance to disable the Save button if the form is not
    valid. We'll see this in context in the upcoming demo. If you've done any two-way data binding in Angular, you are
    already familiar with the ngModel directive. We use this directive on each input element to keep the component class
    property in sync with the user-entered value. In this example, any change to the firstName input element is
    automatically reflected in the firstName property of the customer defined in the component class. When we add an
    ngModel to an input element within a form, Angular automatically creates a FormControl instance, and adds it to the
    form model using the input element's name as the key, hence the reason we need the name attribute here. Angular uses
    that name attribute for the FormControl instance key. The FormControl instances tracks the input element's value and
    state. We can access the FormControl state by exporting the ngModel directive into a template reference variable.
    Here we use a hash to define a template reference variable named firstNameVar, and set it equal to ngModel. This
    variable then references the form control instance for this input element. We can use the template reference
    variable to access the FormControl state. For example, we can use the valid property of the FormControl to determine
    when to display validation messages. We'll see that in the upcoming demo. To use Reactive forms, we first input the
    ReactiveFormsModule to bring in its appropriate set of directives. As you can see, this is an entirely different set
    of directives then for the template-driven approach. Notice how close these directive names map to the FormGroup and
    FormControl building blocks. With the Reactive forms approach, Angular does not create a form model for us, rather
    we create it ourselves in our component class. We then use these directives in the template to bind the form and
    input elements to our defined form model. So for both techniques, building an Angular form requires building a
    template with the appropriate set of directives. Let's take a closer look.</p>

<h3>Template Syntax for Forms</h3>

<p>If you've built any web-based forms you recognize this, no Angular here, it's just HTML. We have a form element, we
    have input elements, such as this input box, along with a label for each data entry field we want to display. Each
    input element has attributes, such as these validation attributes. In this example, the first name is required and
    has a minimum length of 3 characters. Yeah, I know, this minlength validation is a bit funky. How would P. Diddy
    enter his name here, for example? But I wanted to show multiple validation rules for this element. We also have a
    button for the user to submit their entries. When building Angular forms we use this same HTML, and just add the
    appropriate directives for the template-driven or Reactive approach. Let's look at this form using, first, a
    template-driven approach, and then Reactive. A template-driven form looks like this. We still have the form element
    and we're using event binding to bind to a save method when the user submits the form using the Save button, let's
    skip the div element for a moment. We have the same label from this simple HTML example, and the same input element
    with a little more stuff attached to it. Template-driven forms leverage the HTML validation attributes for its
    validation, so those are still here. One of the key features of template-driven forms is how it leverages data
    binding using ngModel. Here we bind a property from our component class to the value of this input element. Two-way
    data binding keeps the input element value and the property value in sync. Template-driven forms require the name
    attribute to properly associate the FormControl with the FormGroup in the generated form model. And here we define a
    template reference variable to access the FormControl instance. Going back to that div element, we use the defined
    template reference variable and check the FormControl state properties to determine whether or not to style the
    input element as an error. Here we are referencing the has-error style class from the Bootstrap style framework. The
    first part of this and operation is checking the FormControl touched state. If the user has touched the element,
    meaning the user set focus to and left the field, than touched is true. The second part of this and operation is
    checking the FormControl valid state. Angular automatically performs the validation as defined by the validation
    attributes. If the input element's value is not valid, the valid property is not true. If touched is true and the
    input element value is not valid, then the div element class changes to has-error, and the field and its label turn
    red. So, why are we checking touched and not valid? Because when the form is displayed empty, we don't want the
    required validation to show the input elements as an error before the user has a chance to enter something. The span
    tag displays our validation message. Note that we are only showing one message here. We'll see how to display both
    our required field message and our min length message when we get to the demo. We again use the form control state
    properties to determine whether to display the message. Here we check the touched property and the errors
    collection. If the input element was touched and the errors collection contains any values; we display the error
    message. How about the Reactive form template? Recall that the form model is built in the component class, so no
    need for template reference variables. Reactive forms do not use two-way binding, so no ngModel or name attribute.
    And with Reactive forms, the validation is defined in the class, so no validation attributes here either. We still
    have the form element, but it now binds the formGroup directive to the form model we create in our component class.
    We still have a label and input element for each data entry field, but now each input element is bound to the name
    of a formControl instance in the form model. To display the validation message and set the error style, the template
    uses the formError property defined in the component class. We'll look at the syntax in detail and build our own
    Reactive form in the next module, but first let's spend a moment looking at the code for a template-driven form,
    just enough to have the background information we need to compare it with Reactive forms.</p>

<h3>Template-driven Form: Template</h3>

<p>In this demo, we'll take a quick look at a template-driven form. If you'd like to code along with the course, now is
    a good time to download the demo project from my GitHub repo here. The first part of this course works with a demo
    application starting with Demo-Start. Later in the course, we'll add a form to a more full-featured application,
    APM, but we'll ignore that project for now. To code along, you'll need a recent version of npm to install all of the
    libraries for the Demo-Start application. I've downloaded the Demo-Start project and moved it to a Demo folder, I
    then opened the Demo folder in VS Code, but you can use any desired editor. VS Code now has an integrated terminal,
    we can open that from the View menu, or with the defined hotkey. From here you can type npm install to install the
    packages for this demo project. I've already done this step, so the node_modules are already in place. I can then
    type npm start to launch the application. Here is a simple form for a customer to sign up for a mailing list. These
    three fields are required, but have not yet been entered. Even though the form is current invalid, notice that no
    validation messages are yet displayed, but because the form state is currently invalid, the Save button is disabled.
    You may have noticed this extra data down here below the form, I'm displaying some of the values from the form model
    that Angular automatically generated for us. The Dirty state of the form is currently false, because we have not yet
    interacted with the form. The Touched state of the form is also false because we have not touched any of the input
    elements. The Valid state is false because the first three input elements have the required attribute, and we have
    no value in those fields. The root FormGroup's Value property displays the name of each input element, along with
    its current value, which is empty at this point. If we set focus to the firstName input element, then leave that
    element, the element has been touched, and we see the validation error message. The Touched state displayed below
    the form is now true. If we enter one character, we see the message change to a different validation message, and
    now that we've typed something, the Dirty state is true. Notice also that the Value is changed to show the entered
    text. If we finish data entry, the validation message disappears, but the Valid property is still false; all input
    elements in the root FormGroup must be valid for the form state to be valid. To complete the form, I'll put in the
    last name and email address. The email validation message appears as soon as we type one character, because one
    character is not a valid email address. We'll see later how we can make this better, but as soon as the email
    address is of a correct format, the validation message disappears. When we've entered valid values into each of the
    required fields, the Save button is enabled. If we check the Send me your catalog checkbox, we see additional fields
    for entry of a postal address. This forms demonstrates the input box, checkbox, radio button, and select box HTML
    elements. Notice also that additional items are added to the Value object. Let's uncheck this for now to shorten the
    form. I'm logging the entire root FormGroup instance to the console when the user clicks on Save, so let's use the
    browser's developer tools to take a look, then click Save. Here is the root FormGroup, we can drill down. Let's
    scroll to the public members. The FormGroup's dirty property is true, just as we've seen, as is touched. Controls
    here is the list of each FormControl associated with this form. The name of each control is the name we defined with
    the input element name attribute, as is the name used in the value object. So template-driven forms gives us all of
    this information with very little effort on our part. Now let's look at the code. Here is the template for the Sign
    Up form. Notice all of these style classes, we are using the Bootstrap styling framework here to make our form look
    good, but you don't have to. Here is the form element, quite similar to the code we saw earlier in the slides. We
    use the novalidate attribute to tell the browser not to perform its validation, but rather to let Angular validate
    the entries. Here we set the templates reference variable to our form model, and when the user submits the form, we
    pass that form model reference to our component's save method, that way our component code can access the form model
    state or values. Here is the firstName input element; wow, that's quite a bit of HTML. We use the ngClass directive
    to set the has-error style class and turn the elements red when the input element was touched or dirty and is not
    valid. We set the validation attributes on the input element itself, here we have required and minlength. We use
    ngModel for the two-way data binding, we set the name attribute so the FormControl instance is associated correctly
    in the form model. We define the template reference variable to use for validation styling and messages. And we
    define the validation messages for the two different possible validation errors, notice the use of the errors
    collection here. When Angular detects a validation error, it adds an entry to the errors collection using the name
    of the validation rule as the key. We can use that name to display the appropriate validation message. Here, we use
    errors.required to display the message appropriate for the required field validation rule. And we use
    errors.minlength to display the message appropriate for the minlength validation rule. Notice how this similar code
    is repeated for each input element on our form. One thing to note about the email validation, as of the time of this
    recording, Angular forms doesn't yet support the validators for the HTML5 input types, such as email, phone, and
    date, so code like this will not work. We instead added a simple pattern for a very basic email format validation.
    Way down at the bottom is the Submit button, notice that we are using the form's template reference variable to
    access the form model's valid property. We disable the button if the form is not valid, and here, after the form, we
    are using the form's template reference variable to display the properties we were looking at in the browser. We
    display the Dirty, Touched, and Valid properties, we also display the Value of the form model, piped into a JSON
    structure for more readable format. Now let's look at the component.</p>

<h3>Template-driven Form: Component</h3>

<p>Wow, not much here. In the component class we define the code to manage our form. There are two key bits of
    information here in our class. The customer property manages the instance of the customer data that we are binding
    to in our template. We can use Go to Definition to view the definition of the customer data model here. We're using
    a class and not an interface in this case, because we want to create a new instance of this class for the new
    customer information. The other important bit of code here is the save method. Our template binds to this method,
    which is executed when the user submits the form. We pass in the form model from the template so we can check the
    form state and view its values. For example, we could skip saving if the user clicked Save without making any
    changes by checking the form's dirty property. It is here that we would call a service to save our data to a
    back-end server. We'll see how to build save functionality later in this course. The bottom line here is that the
    template-driven forms approach minimizes the component class code we need to write, but it is heavy on the template
    code; each control takes a full page of HTML. When using template-driven forms, Angular automatically creates the
    form model, we can then use that to track form and control state, and the ngModel two-way binding takes care of
    keeping our class properties in sync. But often in a real application, forms are more complex than this. Let's look
    at some of these scenarios.</p>

<h3>Complex Scenarios</h3>

<p>Our story begins a week ago when our team met with Marketing to understand the requirements for a signup feature. We
    then developed a first prototype of the form and are presenting it to them today. We show them the form and how well
    it validates the customer's entries per their specifications, and when we click the Send me your catalog button, it
    allows the customer to put in a mailing address to receive our catalog. This prompts our first change request. Can
    we allow multiple addresses, they ask? It seems that our customers often want to receive catalogs at both their home
    and work, and they also want to ensure their subordinates get catalogs too. Who wouldn't want more catalogs? This
    generates some additional ideas. Can we watch what the user types into the Street Address and provide suggestions?
    This would make it easier for the user to send the catalog to multiple people at the same company. Then from the
    back of the room we get a question, can we see that first name validation again? We show them. I don't like that the
    customer sees an error when they type in one character, can't we wait until they stop typing to determine if they've
    entered enough characters? They continue. Many of our customers also like to receive notifications from us via email
    or text message, can we ask for their preference and add a phone number? Be sure to make the phone number required
    only if they pick notifications via text message. We take our list of change requests, and head back to our office.
    Implementing these change requests sounds like we'll end up with a complex set of HTML that will be difficult to
    build and maintain over time. There has to be another way. As we've just seen, template-driven forms is mostly just
    HTML, and is easy to use, but as soon as we start handling more complex scenarios, things get harder and messier.
    Scenarios such as dynamically adding input elements to the form, such as multiple address blocks, adding code to
    watch what the user types and reacting accordingly, waiting validation until the user stops typing, providing
    different validation rules for different situations, and what if your team prefers working with immutable data? That
    means you need to forgo two-way data binding, what then? These scenarios are where the Reactive forms approach
    really shines, as we'll see through the remainder of this course.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>In summary, we can build forms in Angular with the template-driven approach, or with a Reactive approach. In the
    template-driven approach, the form model defining the root FormGroup, FormControls, and any nested FormGroups is
    automatically generated. The validation rules are defined in the HTML, and the input element values and data model
    properties are kept in sync automatically using two-way data binding. With Reactive forms, we manually create the
    FormGroups and FormControls for the form model in our component class. We add the validation in the class, and we
    forgo two-way data binding, instead managing the data flow ourselves. In this module, we looked at the Angular form
    building blocks for building the form model, FormGroup and FormControl. We saw how template-driven and Reactive
    forms use different directives in their template syntax to work with these building blocks. To clearly compare
    template-driven to Reactive forms, we examined the code for a template driven form, and we peeked at the data
    managed by the generated form model. Lastly, we went through a few complex scenarios that may be better suited for a
    Reactive forms approach. Next up, let's try out Reactive forms.</p>
