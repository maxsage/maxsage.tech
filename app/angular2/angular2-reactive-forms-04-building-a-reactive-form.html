<h2>Building a Reactive Form</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Building a form using the Reactive approach means more component code and less HTML. Welcome back to Angular 2:
    Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module we walk through building a simple
    reactive form with a focus on the basics. We'll expand on these basics throughout the remainder of this course.
    Sometimes a simple form is all we need, then the template-driven forms approach makes sense, it's quick and easy,
    and gives you a lot of functionality with very little code. Other times we need more. If you need more
    functionality, more flexibility, or more control of your forms and their associated data, selecting the Reactive
    forms approach may be the better choice. In this module, we build a Reactive form, we start with the component
    class. We update the Angular module to pull in the Reactive form directives, then we modify the template using those
    directives. We look at how to use setValue and patchValue to update form values. Lastly, we see how to simplify our
    component class with FormBuilder. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>The Component Class</h3>

<p>Recall from the prior module that when we use the template-driven approach, Angular automatically generates the form
    model by creating the FormGroup and FormControl instances for us, and we use ngModel for two-way binding to keep the
    user's entries and the data model properties in sync. With the Reactive forms approach, we define the form model by
    creating the FormGroup and FormControl instances ourselves in our component class. We then bind the template to the
    form model; this means that our form is not directly modifying our data model. So how do we create the form model?
    Every form model requires at least one FormGroup, which I call the root FormGroup. This is the FormGroup that
    represents the entire form. The data structure for our demo form's root FormGroup is shown here. It contains
    properties to retain state, to set default values, and retain user entries, and a child controls collection that
    represents the content of the form. A form model often has one FormControl in this controls collection for each
    input element on the form. Though this is not required, we could have input elements on our form that we don't need
    to track. For example, we could have a checkbox or a select element that manages part of the UI, but does not need
    to be tracked by our form model. The controls collection can included nested FormGroups to group sets of controls or
    other nested FormGroups. We'll look at nested FormGroups later in this course. The controls collection can also
    include FormArrays to work with groups of FormControls or FormGroups as an array. We'll try out FormArrays later in
    this course. We start creation of our form model with the root FormGroup. One way to create that root FormGroup is
    shown here. This code imports the FormGroup from angular/forms, so we can use it as the data type for our form
    model. We declare the root FormGroup here, this property holds the reference to our form model. Our form collects
    data from our customers, so we'll call it customerForm. Here we define our data model, we are managing customer data
    so we call it Customer. In the ngOnInit lifecycle hook method, we assign the customerForm property to a new instance
    of the FormGroup; this creates the root FormGroup for the form model. We could put this code in the constructor
    instead, but we selected to use ngOnInit to ensure the component and template are initialized before building the
    form model. In the FormGroup constructor we pass in an object; this object contains the FormControls and any nested
    FormGroups that comprise the contents of this root FormGroup. Like this, we first add FormControl to the import
    statement from angular/forms. In the FormGroup constructor, we add a set of key and value pairs. The key is the
    FormControl name, and the value is a new instance of a FormControl. We repeat this, one for each input element on
    the form. We can optionally pass a default value to the FormControl constructor as shown here. In this case, we pass
    true as the default value for the sendCatalog input element. We can also pass validation rules here in the
    FormControl constructor. We'll talk about validation in the next module. Let's jump into a demo and see how to
    change our current template-driven Form into a Reactive form.</p>

<h3>The Component Class: Demo</h3>

<p>In this demo, we build the form model for our demo form. We are back in our demo project just as we left it from the
    prior module. We are about to switch our demo form from the template-driven approach to the Reactive approach, so if
    you want to retain the code for the template-driven approach for future reference, now is the time to make a copy of
    your project folder. Are we ready to tackle the Reactive forms approach? Let's begin with the component class.
    First, let's delete the code we added specifically to look at the template-driven forms model. We don't need to pass
    the form into the save method, so let's delete that. Then we no longer need ngForm here, so we can delete that as
    well. Whenever we build a form using the Reactive approach, we start by importing our building blocks because we
    know we're going to need them. We import both FormGroup and FormControl from angular/forms. With the Reactive forms
    approach, we explicitly create instances of these building blocks to define our form model. Let's specify a property
    from the root FormGroup and call it customerForm, its type is FormGroup. This root FormGroup defines our form model.
    Our template will bind to this property to associate the HTML form element with this root FormGroup instance. We'll
    use the same data model as with the template-driven approach. Let's make one more change here to fix up our
    console.log. Now we'll log our customerForm property using this. Now we need to create and initialize this FormGroup
    property. We could do it right here on the declaration, or we could add it to the component class constructor, or we
    could put it in a lifecycle hook. Let's add it to the OnInit lifecycle hook, so that the instance is created when
    the form is initialized. First we import OnInit from angular/core, then we add the implements keyword to tell
    TypeScript that we want to implement the OnInit interface. Lastly, we implement the ngOnInit method. In this method
    we use the conventional syntax to create an instance of the FormGroup class using the new keyword, this.customerForm
    = new FormGroup. This creates an instance of the FormGroup and assigns it to our CustomerForm property. But we see a
    syntax error here. If we hover over this error we see that the FormGroup constructor requires that we pass in a set
    of controls that are associated with this FormGroup, each control is defined with a key and value pair where the key
    is the control name and the value is an AbstractControl. AbstractControl is the base class for FormControl and
    FormGroup. This means that our FormGroup can be initialized with FormControls and nested FormGroups. For now, we'll
    just initialize the FormGroup with a set of FormControls. We're passing in an object so we use curly braces, then we
    add a FormControl for each input element in the templates form. Let's start with the first name. We'll give it a
    control name of firstName and create a new FormControl instance using the new keyword. We repeat this syntax for the
    lastName, and create a new FormControl instance for it. Same for the email address, and the sendCatalog flag. If we
    want to set a default value in any of the associated input elements, we pass that to the FormControl constructor.
    Our Marketing Department, of course, wants the Send catalog option checked on by default, so we set that default by
    simply passing true into the constructor for the sendCatalog FormControl. We've now defined our form's root
    FormGroup with a FormControl for each of our four input elements. This structure is the form model, and tracks the
    form value and state. Don't confuse this form model with our data model. The form model defines the set of
    FormGroups and FormControls that match up with the HTML form and input elements. The data model defines the data
    passed to and from a back-end server; we are using the same Customer class data model as the template-driven
    approach. This is a good start, but before we can update the template to bind to our FormGroup and FormControls, we
    need to pull in the appropriate directives.</p>

<h3>The Angular Module</h3>

<p>We can think of an Angular module as a box. The box contains a related set of components. The templates associated
    with any component we declare in an Angular module can only access directives declared or imported into that same
    Angular module. If your Customer-Components template wants to use the Reactive forms directives, the
    Reactive-FormsModule must be added to the imports array in the same Angular module. If you are not familiar with
    Angular modules, consider watching the Angular 2: Getting Started course, which covers Angular modules in detail.
    Let's update our Angular module now. We are looking at the application's root Angular module called AppModule; it is
    here that we declared our CustomerComponent. The template in the CustomerComponent wants to use the Reactive forms
    directives, so it is in the same Angular module that we add the Reactive FormsModule to the imports array. Recall
    that FormsModule was for template-driven forms. Let's just change that to ReactiveFormsModule here and here. We are
    now set up to use the Reactive Forms directives. The templates associated with any component declared in this
    Angular module can now access these Reactive forms directives. Let's update our template next.</p>

<h3>The Template</h3>

<p>Now that we've defined the form model with its root FormGroup and its associated FormControls in the component class,
    we can update the template to bind to that form model. We bind the form to the FormGroup, and each input element to
    its associated FormControl using the Reactive forms directives. As we saw in the last module, these are the
    directives provided for Reactive Forms, we'll look at formGroup and formControlName here. We'll look at more of
    these directives later in this course. We use the formGroup directive to bind the form element in the template to
    the root FormGroup of our form model. We use square brackets to denote property binding, and assign it to the form
    model property from our component class. The form then knows not to build its own form model, and to instead use the
    one defined by the customerForm property. We use the formControlName directive to bind each input element to its
    associated FormControl. We bind to the name of the FormControl instance as defined in the form model. Here, we bind
    to the firstName formControl. Notice that there are no square brackets here, we are binding to a simple string name,
    not to a property. We add the formControlName directive to every input element within the form that we want to
    track. For styling, display of the validation error messages, and other purposes, the template may want to access
    the form model properties. For example, we may want to access the firstName FormControl properties to determine if
    the first name input element was touched or is valid. There are several techniques for accessing the form model
    properties. One option is to navigate through the form model hierarchy. For example, to access the valid property
    for the firstName FormControl, we would use customerForm, our form model, .controls to access the collection of
    controls on the form, .firstName to access the first name FormControl, and .valid to access the desired property of
    that control. Alternatively, we can take advantage of the FormGroup's get method to reference the FormControl. We
    would use customerForm, our form model, .get to call the get method, passing in firstName to find the reference to
    the first name control, and .valid to access the desired property of that control. This syntax is often shorter,
    especially when working with nested FormGroups. Watch the quotes here because often this syntax is within a quoted
    string, if the outside quoted string uses double quotes, then this argument should be in single quotes. A third
    option is to define a separate property in the component class for the input element. We then use this property when
    creating the FormGroup. In the template, we can then reference the FormControl with this property. This technique is
    most useful for controls referenced frequently in the template or in the code. Let's try out the FormGroup and
    FormControl name directives in our template. Let's start with a form element. We associate the form element with the
    root FormGroup, we do that using the formGroup directive to bind the form element to the FormGroup instance property
    we defined in the component class. We'll use square brackets to define property binding, and bind to our
    customerForm property. We can delete the template reference variable here and here, because our template can access
    the customerForm property directly. Recall that the Save button was also using the signupForm template reference
    variable. Here, we can replace the template reference variable with our customerForm property, our button is still
    disabled if our FormGroup is not valid, but now we reference the FormGroup instance we created instead of one that
    Angular had generated for us. And if we still want to see the values of our FormGroup, we can change these logging
    lines to use customerForm as well. Next, let's hook up our input elements starting with the first name. We'll remove
    the ngModel, we no longer need the name attribute, and we'll delete the template reference variable. Instead, we'll
    use the formControlName directive to bind this input element to the name of the associated FormControl, in this case
    firstName. We don't need square brackets here because we are binding to a simple string, not a property. We then
    replace the template reference variable here in the div that sets the validation error style. We can use any one of
    the three techniques we saw in the slides to reference the desired form model object. I'll use Search/Replace to
    quickly replace the template reference variables with the customerForm get method. This is looking a bit messy here
    with lots of logic that may be better in the component class. We'll refactor this code a little later in this
    course. For now I'll go off and repeat these changes for the last name, email address, and send catalog checkbox. If
    you are coding along, be sure to delete the ngModel directive, name attribute, and template reference variable from
    each input element, and add the form ControlName directive, then use Search/Replace to replace each reference to the
    template reference variable with a customerForm.get method. Note that the directive name and the FormControl string
    names are case sensitive. Are we ready to move on? We still have all of these other input elements here for the
    customer's street address, let's comment them out for now so we can get this part of the form working. Now we're
    ready to try it out in the browser. And here is our first Reactive form. If the form does not display for you, use
    the developer tools and view the messages in the console. On this form, each of the input elements display
    correctly, and our default for the Send catalog checkbox is set to true. The address input elements don't display
    here because we commented them out. Looking at the values below the form, the value of each state here is false. If
    we give focus to the First Name field, and then leave the field, we see the appropriate validation error message,
    and we see that Touched now is true. If we type in a character we see the minimum length error message, and Dirty is
    now true, and if we put in valid values for each field, Valid is true. The Value property displays the key and value
    pairs for each FormControl registered with the FormGroup. Notice that the keys are the names we defined for each
    FormControl instance, and the values are our entered inputs, so the form model works the same, it's just that now
    we're creating it ourselves. But, what if we want to change the value of an input element from our component class?
    Say we want to set defaults after the form model is initialized. We aren't using two-way binding anymore, so
    changing the data model won't change the form values. How do we update the input element values on our form from our
    component class code?</p>

<h3>Using setValue and patchValue</h3>

<p>To update input elements on the form from our component class, we use setValue or patchValue. Use setValue to set the
    value of every FormControl in the form model. In this example, we have three FormControls and we set the value of
    each one. If we only want to set a subset of the values, we use patchValue instead, here we only set two of the
    values. Let's give this a try. To try this out, we'll add a button to our demo form template to provide some test
    data on the form. We'll use event binding to bind to a populateTestData method. Next, we need to write that method
    in the component class. I'll paste the code and we can talk through it. In this method, we use setValue to update
    each of the values in the form model. Let's check it out in the browser. Looking at the form, we see our new Test
    Data button. Click it, and the form populates with the defined values, but what if we only wanted to populate the
    name fields? If we go back to the method and remove the email address, for example, then look back at the form in
    the browser, if we open the developer tools, then click Test Data, we see an error message in the console, Must
    supply a value for form control with name: email. That's because the setValue requires that we set the value of
    every FormControl in the form model. What do we do? If you said patchValue, you are correct. Let's change setValue
    here to patchValue, recheck the form in the browser, click Test Data, and it works. Use setValue when setting all of
    the FormControls on the form, use patchValue to assign values for a subset of the FormControls. We'll see a more
    real-world example of these features later in this course. Looking back at the code that created the form model,
    this code is a bit long, and will be even longer if we add all of the address fields. Wouldn't it be nice if there
    was an easier way to write this code block? And there is, let's check out the FormBuilder next.</p>

<h3>Simplifying with FormBuilder</h3>

<p>FormBuilder is a class we can use when building Reactive forms to create the form model from a configuration. We can
    think of it as a factory that creates FormGroups and FormControls for us. The FormBuilder shortens the boilerplate
    code required to create an instance of the root FormGroup and its associated FormControls and nested FormGroups.
    This can make the code that creates the form model easier to read and maintain. The FormBuilder is provided as a
    service, so we access the FormBuilder instance using dependency injection. Since the FormBuilder is provided as a
    service, we follow the same steps we do for every other Angular server we use. We import FormBuilder with code that
    looks like this. We inject the FormBuilder instance using the class constructor, like this. Lastly, we use that
    instance to create our FormGroup, notice that we no longer need to create new instances of FormGroup or FormControl
    here. We'll look at this syntax more in a moment, first let's try out FormBuilder. Here in the component class we
    import FormBuilder from angular/forms. Our class currently has no explicit constructor, so we need to add one, then
    we inject the FormBuilder instance using the constructor parameter. Now we can use that FormBuilder instance to
    create our FormGroup. Instead of creating a root FormGroup instance using the new keyword, we'll use the FormBuilder
    instance and call its group method. The group method allows us to define the set of controls and nested FormGroups
    that are associated with the root FormGroup. Instead of explicitly creating a new FormControl instance, we simply
    set the default value. We could set the default value to anything, we'll set the defaults to an empty string for all
    but the sendCatalog FormControl. The group method returns an initialized root FormGroup instance with all of its
    associated FormControls and nested FormGroups. Now we can delete our original code, and remove FormControl from the
    import statement, because we no longer use it as a data type. Does this look easier to read without all of the
    cruft? Let's bring the form up in the browser and see that it still works. Let's take a closer look at the
    FormBuilder's FormControl syntax. The FormBuilder group method takes in a control configuration object that defines
    the FormControls associated with the FormGroup. In this example, we define two FormControls, firstName and
    sendCatalog. Each control configuration object is comprised of a key and value pair, the key is the FormControl
    name, such as firstName here. The value can be an expression that defines the default value for the FormControl. For
    example, the last entry has a key of sendCatalog and a default value of true. Alternatively, the value can be an
    object with two properties, value and disabled. The value property is the default value, as before, and the disabled
    property is a Boolean, defining whether the input element should be disabled. We'll see that in the upcoming demo.
    Yet another option allows specifying an array, the first element of the array is the default value expression or the
    object with the value and disabled state. The next two elements of the array, not shown here, define the validation
    rules. We'll look at validation in the next module. Now let's try out an alternate syntax. To try out an alternate
    syntax, let's change the lastName value to be an object with a default value and a disabled state. Let's check that
    out in the browser. We see that the last name default appears, and the input element is disabled, it works. Notice
    also that the lastName no longer appears in the Value property for the root FormGroup. This could be a useful
    feature in a situation that needs this functionality, but we don't need it here, so let's change it back to an empty
    string default. Looking back at our template, notice that our validation is all still here. We could leave it here,
    but if we want all of the benefits of Reactive forms, we'll want to move it into our component code as well. We'll
    do that in the next module. For now, let's finish up this module with some checklists we can use as we build our own
    Reactive forms.</p>

<h3>Checklists & Summary</h3>

<p>Checklists are a great way to recheck our understanding and our work. When building forms using the Reactive
    approach, the component class is in charge. In that class we create a property for the root FormGroup. We use this
    property to bind the form element in the template, then we create the FormGroup instance and pass in each
    FormControl instance, like this, but we can simplify this code using the FormBuilder. To use the FormBuilder, we
    import it using an import statement. We inject the FormBuilder instance into the class constructor, and we use that
    instance like this. The group method returns an initialized root FormGroup instance with all of its associated form
    controls. Before we can use the Reactive forms directives in our template, we need to pull them into our Angular
    module. We start by importing the ReactiveFormsModule using the import statement, we then add the
    ReactiveFormsModule to the imports array property of the ngModule decorator, like this. This makes the Reactive
    forms directives available to all templates associated with components defined in the declarations array. Note that
    our demo application has only one feature component, so it is defined in AppModule. In a real application, your form
    may be declared in a feature module. In that case, the ReactiveFormsModule should be added to the imports array of
    that feature module. We'll see this when we look at the APM sample application later in this course. We then bind
    the components template to the form model. In the form element we use the FormGroup directive and property binding
    to bind to the root FormGroup property we defined in the component class, in this example, that property was called
    customerForm. In each input element we used the FormControlName directive to bind to the name of the associated
    FormControl. The name we specify here is the name we set when creating the FormControl, and remember that these
    strings are case sensitive. After performing each of these steps, we have a Reactive form managed by the form model
    we define in the component class. In this module, we converted our template-driven form into a basic Reactive form.
    It began in the component class, where we explicitly created instances of the form building blocks, FormGroup and
    FormControl. Next we modified the application's Angular module to add the Reactive forms module to the imports
    array, and pull in the Reactive forms directives. Then we updated the template elements to bind to the FormGroup and
    FormControls we defined in the component class. We tried out the setValue and patchValue to update the input element
    values from the component code. Lastly, we saw how to use the FormBuilder to simplify the boilerplate code and
    create the root FormGroup and its associated FormControls with less cruft. But there's a bit more work to do, let's
    look at validation next.</p>
