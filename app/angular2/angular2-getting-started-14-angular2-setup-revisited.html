<h2>Angular 2 Setup Revisited</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Angular application setup process may have seemed a bit like wizardry. Packages and libraries magically
  installed and the typescript compiler psychically knowing what to do. Welcome back to Angular 2 getting started
  from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata and in this module we revisit the basic files we need to set up an
  Angular application. What looked like installation wizardry was instead a set of carefully defined setup files.
  Let's peek behind the curtain and see what those files are, what information they contain and how to use them. In
  this module, we'll take a closer look at the TypeScript configuration file, the TypeScript definitions file, the
  npm package file, the SystemJS configuration file and the scripts defined in index.html. Then we'll revisit the
  bootstrapping process and take a brief look at the Angular CLI. Let's get started.</p>

  target="psplayer">TypeScript Configuration File (tsconfig.json) &amp; TypeScript Definitions File
  (typings.json)</a></h3>
<p>To begin coding with Angular quickly at the beginning of this course, I provided the basic files needed to set up
  our development environment. Those files are part of the starter files you may have downloaded from the GetHub
  repository for this course, as detailed in the first things first module. Now let's revisit each of these files
  and see what they do. Note that the content of these files may change over time so don't worry if your files don't
  look exactly as those shown in these demos. With that said, let's get to know some of these files better, starting
  with tsconfig.json. This file is a TypeScript configuration file. It specifies TypeScript compile options and
  other settings. The TypeScript compiler tsc reads this file and uses these options and settings. The presence of
  this file in a folder indicates that the folder is the root of a TypeScript project. Most of today's browsers only
  understand the ES5 version of JavaScript, so we need to tell the TypeScript compiler to transpile our TypeScript
  code into ES5 code. So ES5 is our target. The sourceMap option defines whether TypeScript should generate map
  files. Map files assist with debugging, so it's a good idea to set this to true. The emitDecoratorMetadata and
  experimentalDecorators options provide support for our decorators. These must be set to true or our Angular
  application won't compile. The noImplicitAny option defines whether the TypeScript compiler will default untyped
  variables to a type of any if it cannot infer the type. If we want to insure all of our variables are strongly
  typed, we can change this to true. Feel free to add or change this file as needed to configure the TypeScript
  compiler to the needs of your application and environment. So, disappointingly, the TypeScript compiler isn't
  psychic. It uses this file to know how to compile our TypeScript code. Some JavaScript libraries extend the
  JavaScript environment with features and syntax that the TypeScript compiler doesn't understand. We can use
  TypeScript definition files, d.ts files, to tell the TypeScript compiler about the libraries we load. These days
  many libraries include their type definition files within their npm packages so they are retrieved when the
  library is installed. We don't have to do anything extra in this case. For example, here is the TypeScript
  definition file for the common package we imported in the last course module. This file was downloaded when we
  used npm install to download the Angular packages. For those libraries that don't provide their type definition
  files as part of their npm packages, we can use a typings tool to find and retrieve these files. The typings.json
  file contains the list of these libraries. We specify the typings for core.js, which brings ES2015 capabilities to
  ES5 browsers. And we need node to develop and build our application and to use tools such as LightServer, even if
  we won't use node as our backend server. This typings.json file is processed automatically as part of the
  installation process, as we'll see when we look at the package.json file. Let's look at that next.</p>
<h3>npm Package File (package.json)</h3>
<p>One of the most important files for successful setup and development time execution is the npm package file, or
  package.json. When setting up Angular, we use npm to install the Angular libraries and all of their
  dependencies. And we use npm to run scripts, such as npm start to launch our application. Looking at the contents
  of this file provides helpful insight into how npm knows what to do. This file contains basic information about
  the application, such as the application name, version, author, description and so on. For our purposes, the key
  settings in this file are scripts, dependencies and dev dependencies. These are the settings that provide the
  magic when installing and running an Angular application. Let's look at the dependencies first. In this file,
  there are two sets of dependencies. The dependencies defines the libraries that our application needs to run. Here
  is Angular, systemjs, our modular loader, and reactive extensions, for example. And I added Twitter bootstrap here
  because we use it in the sample application for styling. The devDependencies define the additional libraries we
  need for development. Here is where we define TypeScript. And some support libraries that the scripts use. We'll
  talk about these scripts in a moment. At the beginning of this course, we set up Angular by typing npm install
  from the folder containing this file. When we issued that command, npm reads these dependencies, locates each of
  these libraries in its repository by name, and installs the specified version. But please note, as with any
  software, these libraries will most likely change over time and the versions you see may differ from the version
  numbers shown here. Feel free to add or modify these entries as needed to include any other third-party library or
  npm package. Up here, we see the list of scripts that we can run with npm. We can execute any of these scripts
  from the command line using npm run and the script name, except for start, which does not require the run key
  word. Using npm run tsc, runs the TypeScript compiler. We can use the dash W flag with the TypeScript compiler to
  run the compiler in watch mode. This keeps the compiler running, awaiting changes to any TypeScript files and
  recompiling as needed. LightServer is a lightweight static file server that we use to run our application without
  any backend server and was specifically written for Angular 2. Using npm start, runs the TypeScript compiler and
  the LightServer at the same time. So whenever we save a change to any of our files, tsc will recompile them and
  LightServer will refresh the browser automatically so we can immediately see our changes. We saw this in action
  throughout the demos in this course. Using npm run typings, runs the typings tool. For TypeScript to be strongly
  typed, it needs to know about each library's types. These files our stored in TypeScript type definition files and
  indicated with a d.ts extension. Most libraries install their own associated TypeScript type definition files, so
  we don't have to do anything extra to install them. We put any other typings files in the typings.json file.
  Running the typings tool installs any typings defined in this file. postInstall is called by npm
  automatically after it successfully completes the installation of the package. Here we have set up postInstall so
  that after npm install is complete, any TypeScript type definition files in the typings.json file are installed as
  well. </p>
<h3>SystemJS Configuration File (systemjs.config.js)</h3>
<p>As its name implies, the SystemJS configuration file configures SystemJS. SystemJS is an ES module loader that
  automatically loads each of the files for our application. That way we don't have to add script tags for every
  file we use in our application. The paths property defines an alias where our system files are located. In this
  case, in the node modules folder. The map property defines to the module loader where all of our Angular pieces
  are located. We looked at the packages property earlier in this course when we walked through the application
  bootstrap process. The app property defines which file in the app folder should be loaded first, which is main,
  and provides a default extension for the paths we specify in our import statements. Now let's move on to the
  index.html file.
</p>
<h3>index.html File Scripts</h3>
<p>We've covered the contents of the index.html file previously in this course. But let's spend a moment looking
  closer at the libraries we are loading with the scripts tags. This first one is for core js. This library brings
  ES2015 capabilities to ES5 browsers. We included the typings for this library in the typings.json file. A zone is
  an execution context that persists across asynchronous tasks. Angular uses zones for change detection and data
  binding. So we probably want that. Reflect metadata is used by Angular to support reading decorator metadata, so
  we probably want that too. And this is SystemJS, the module loader we discussed in the prior clip. So there is no
  wizardry here. Just a set of carefully defined setup files. Next, let's revisit the bootstrapping process. </p>
<h3>Bootstrapping Revisited</h3>
<p>Recall from the beginning of this course that we bootstrapped our root application module in the main.ts file as
  shown here. We used dynamic bootstrapping and the just in time, or JIT, compiler. This means that the Angular
  compiler compiles the application in the browser and then launches the application starting with the root
  application module, AppModule. This is similar to how most client-side web applications work. Alternatively, we
  could use static bootstrapping and the Angular ahead of time, or AOT compiler. By compiling ahead of time, we can
  produce a much smaller application that launches faster, especially on mobile devices and high latency networks.
  To use the static option, the Angular compile runs ahead of time as part of your build process and produces a
  collection of files that contain class factories. Setting up a build process, and using the AOT compiler, is out
  of the scope of this course. But I did want to make you aware of it and show you how this file changes when you
  use ahead of time compilation. The code to bootstrap a pre-compiled application is similar to what we have here.
  Note that I have not run the AOT compiler, so I don't have this factory. That's why we see a syntax error here.
  Notice how similar these two sets of code are. We use platformBrowser instead of platformBrowserDynamic. We use
  bootstrapModuleFactory instead of bootstrapModule, and we bootstrap the AppModule factory instead of the AppModule
  itself. Even though I've pasted both sets of code here so we could compare them, you would always use one or the
  other, never both. So I'll delete this code. For more information on the ahead of time compiler, or AOT, see the
  Angular documentation.>Next up, let's take a quick peek at the Angular CLI. </p>
<h3>Angular CLI</h3>
<p>Throughout this course, we have built our Angular application manually. That is one of the best ways to learn, by
  building each component and typing each class definition and metadata. But as you start to build your
  application, you may want to use the Angular CLI, or command line interface. The Angular CLI can generate the
  pieces of our application for us. With simple command line syntax, we can create a working Angular
  application with all of the required starter files, and we can add components, directives, pipes, services, or
  Angular modules to that application. This command adds a new component to the application called product list. The
  CLI provides much more, include generating unit and end to end tests. The best place to start with the CLI is
  cli.angular.io website. There we can get started with the CLI and learn about its commands. Here is the Angular
  CLI website. If we click get started, it takes us to the GetHub repository. At the time of this recording, the CLI
  version is beta 16 and still changing. So we won't demo this CLI here. Looking at the read me, and navigating down
  to the installation process, we see that we can install the Angular CLI with a simple npm command. To generate an
  Angular project, type ng for Angular,new, and the project name, such as apm. The CLI creates a set of files for
  us. These files include all of the setup starter files, the root application module AppModule, and the root
  application component AppComponent, along with the first cut of unit and end to end tests. We just need to fill in
  the details. We can also use the CLI to generate components, directives, pipes and services as detailed here. The
  Angular CLI provides the quick and easy way to build your Angular application without the need to download or
  install setup or configuration files. And I'm sure it will only get better and more fully featured as time goes
  on. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In this module, we revisited the setup files. We found that the TypeScript compiler is not psychic, rather it
  uses the TypeScript configuration file for options and settings when compiling our TypeScript code. We peeked at
  the TypeScript definitions file containing the typings we need. We then saw that npm is not wizardry, rather it
  uses the npm package file to specify the operation of npm install, npm start, and npm run. We looked at the
  SystemJS configuration file and how it configures the module loader that we use. And we looked at the libraries
  specified in the index.html file scripts tags. Then we revisited the bootstrapping process and talked about the
  bootstrapping difference when using JIT versus AOT compilation. Lastly, we took a quick look at the Angular CLI.
  Consider trying it out to generate the boilerplate from your application. Only one module left.</p>
