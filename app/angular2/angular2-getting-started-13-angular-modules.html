<h2>Angular Modules</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>As we've seen throughout this course Angular modules are a key part of any Angular application. Welcome back to
  Angular Two, getting started from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata and in this course module we focus on
  Angular modules and how to use them to better organize our code. Ooo, it's so beautiful. No, it's not a van Gogh,
  not even a Picasso. And yeah, it sort of looks like a metro map. This is a picture of what our application could
  look like if leverage the power of Angular modules instead of one large app module like we have now, there are
  multiple modules, and each piece of our application has a logical place within one of those modules. This keeps
  each module smaller and more manageable. In this course module we take another look at the definition and purpose
  of an Angular module. We then focus in on the Angular module Metadata to better understand how to use it. We
  leverage that knowledge to create a feature module for our application, and take it one step further defining a
  shared module to reduce duplication. Lastly, we reexamine our applications root Angular module. Let's get
  started.</p>
<h3>What Is an Angular Module?</h3>
<p>What is an Angular module?>As we've seen earlier in this course, an Angular module is a class with an NgModule
  decorator. It's purpose, to organize the pieces of our application, arrange them into cohesive blocks of
  functionality, and extend our application with capabilities from external libraries. Angular modules library the
  environment for resolving the directives and pipes in our components templates. We'll talk more about those in a
  few moments. End modules are a great way to selectively aggregate classes from other modules, and re-export them
  in a consolidated convenience module. BrowserModule, HttpModule and RouterModule are all examples of this, and
  we'll create our own convenience module when we build a shared module a little later. An Angular module can be
  loaded eagerly when the application starts or it can be lazy loaded asynchronously by the router. Lazy loading is
  out of the scope of this course, but it's discussed in detail in the Angular documentation. How does an Angular
  module organize our application? An Angular module declares each component, directive and pipe that it manages.
  Every component, directive and pipe we create belongs to an Angular module. An Angular module bootstraps our root
  application component. Defining the component needed to display our first template. An Angular module can export
  components, directives, pipes and even other Angular modules, making them available for other modules to import
  and use. An Angular module imports other Angular modules. This brings in the export functionality from those
  imported modules. An Angular module can register service providers with the Angular injector, makign the services
  available to any class in the application. We can think of Angular module as a box. Inside that box we declare
  each of our components. If those components need any functionality that functionality also needs to be
  defined within this box. The AppComponent sets up the routing for our main menu using routerLink and includes the
  router outlet directive, so it needs the the router directive's router service and routes which are defined in
  RouterModule. The ProductList-Component uses ngModel, so it needs the forms module. The ProductList-Component also
  used ngFor and ngIf, so it needs the BrowserModule. The ProductList-Component used the ProductFilterPipe, so it
  needs that too. The ProductList-Component also uses the starRating components directive, so it needs that as well
  and so until the box contains everything that each our components needs. Saying this another way, for each
  component that belongs to an Angular module that Angular module provides the environment for template
  resolution. The module defines which set of components, directives, and pipes are available to the components
  template. Each declared components template is resolved using only the capabilities provided within that module.
  Let's look at our ProductList-Component as an example. The ProductList-components template used ngModel, so
  ngModel must be available within this module. We achieve that by importing the Angular Forms-Module. The
  ProductList-components template also uses a directive we created, the Star-Component. So the Star-Component must
  be available within this module. Since the Star-Component is one we created we can either declare the
  Star-Component within the module directly, or we can import another module that exports the Star-Component.
  Importing an Angular module brings in the functionality exported by that module, and we'd need to do one or the
  other, never both. We didn't need to thin about template resolution much in our sample application up until now
  because all of the pieces of our application are in one Angular module, but we will need to keep this in mind as
  we split our application into multiple Angular modules. Let's take a quick look at our current app module. Here's
  the Angular module we defined throughout this course, it is the application's root Angular module, and by
  convention is called AppModule. The AppModule imports the system Angular modules we need, including the
  RouterModule which is where we configured our routes. It declares each component and pipe that we created in this
  course. It registers the service provider for our ProductDetailGuard, and it bootstraps the application with the
  root application component, AppComponent. We have a lot of information in here, and we're mixing up basic
  application pieces such as our WelcomeComponent with pieces specific to our product feature. And look at all those
  import statements. Let's journey through the NgModule MetaData to better understand how Angular modules work, so
  we can then refactor our app module into multiple modules for better code organization. </p>
<h3>Bootstrap Array</h3>
<p>As we have seen, every Angular application has at least one Angular module called the Root Application Module or
  AppModule. And an Angular application has at least one component called the root application component or
  AppComponent. The AppModule bootstraps the AppComponent to provide the directive use in index.html file. We cover
  the bootstrap in-process in the introduction to components earlier in this course. The bootstrap array of the
  NgModule decorator defines the component that is the starting point of the application. This is the component that
  is loaded  when the application is launched. Here are some things to keep in mind  when using the bootstrap array.
  Every application must bootstrap at least one component, the root application component. We do this by simply
  adding the root application component to the bootstrap array of the root application module. The bootstrap array
  should only be used in the root application module, AppModule. As we build other Angular modules we won't use the
  bootstrap array. </p>
<h3>Declarations Array</h3>
<p>Every component, directive, and pipe we create is declared by an Angular module. We use the declarations array of
  the NgModule decorator to define the components, directives, and pipes that belong to this Angular module. Here
  are some things to keep in mind when using the declarations array. Every component, directive, and pipe we create
  has to belong to one and only one Angular module. In our sample application all of our components are defined in
  one Angular module, AppModule. It would be better to divide the components into multiple modules with basic
  application pieces in the app module and feature pieces in appropriate feature modules. We'll do that a little
  later in this course module. As we separate out our pieces it is important to remember that each component,
  directive, and pipe belongs to one and only one Angular module. Only declare components, directives and pipes.
  Don't add other classes, services or modules to the declarations array. Never re-declare components, directives or
  pipes that belong to another module. This is a corollary to truth number one. If we re-declare than the component,
  directive or pipe no longer belongs to one and only Angular module. For example, the Star-Component directive
  belongs to Module B so we should never re-declare Star-Component in Module A. We should only declare components,
  directives and pipes that belong to this module. All declared components, directives and pipes are private by
  default. They are only accessible to other components, directives and pipes declared in the same module. So if we
  declare the Star-Component in Module B by default that component is not available to components in other Angular
  modules. We share components, directives and pipes by exporting them. We'll talk more about exporting in a few
  moments. The Angular module provides the template resolution environment for its components templates. When we
  include a component in the declarations array of an Angular module, the component belongs to that Angular module.
  That components templates, directives, and pipes are then resolved within that module. When we use a directive in
  a components template, like the ai-star directive shown here, Angular looks to the module for the definition of
  that directive. If the component defining that directive is not declared within the same Angular module or
  exported from an imported module, Angular won't find the directive and will generate an error. For this example,
  the Star-Component must be declared in the same module as the ProductList-Component so Angular can find the
  template for the ai-star directive. Or the Star-Component must be exported from an imported module, never
  both. </p>
<h3>Exports Array</h3>
<p>The exports array of the NgModule decorator allows us to share an Angular module's components, directives and
  pipes with other modules. We can export any of this module's components, directives and pipes so they can be
  pulled in when another module imports this module. We can also re-export system Angular modules. such as
  FormsModule and HttpModule. We can re-export 3rd party modules such as Material Design. Material Design is a set
  of high quality user interface components including buttons and dialogs. And we can re-export out own modules.
  Here are some things to keep in mind when using the exports array. Export any component, directive or pipe if
  another component needs it. A module can export any of its declared components, directives or pipes. Re-export
  modules to re-export their components, directives, and pipes. This is useful when consolidating features from
  multiple modules to build a convenience or shared module. We can re-export something without importing it first.
  An Angular module only needs to import the components, directives and pipes that are required by the components
  declared in the module. But the Angular module can still provide capabilities to other modules that import it by
  re-exporting. In this example my SharedModule exports the FormsModule even though it did not import it. So any
  module that imports the SharedModule will have access to the NgModule and other forms directives. We'll see this
  in an upcoming demo. Never export a service. Services added to the the provider's array of an Angular module are
  registered with a root application injector. Making them available for injection into any class on the
  application. So there is no point in exporting them. They are already shared throughout the application. </p>
<h3>Imports Array</h3>
<p>An Angular module can be extended by importing capabilities from other Angular modules. The imports array of the
  NgModule decorator allows us to import supporting modules that export components, directives or pipes. We then use
  those exported components, directives and pipes within the templates of components that are declared in this
  module. Many Angular system libraries are Angular modules such as the FormsModule and HttpModule we've used in
  this course. We can import Angular modules to use their capabilities. Many 3rd part libraries are also Angular
  modules such as Material Design. We can import 3rd part Angular modules to use their capabilities. We can import
  our own modules to extend our application with additional features or share capabilities across several
  modules. We'll see that in an upcoming demo, and we could separate out our route configurations into it's own
  module or set of modules and import that. Here are some things to keep in mind when using the imports array.
  Importing a module makes available any exported components, directives and pipes from that module. We call that we
  are using ngModel in our ProductList-Component for two way binding. The ngModel directive is exported in the
  FormsModule. By importing the FormsModule into our AppModule we can use ngModel in any component declared in our
  AppModule. Only import what this module needs. Only import modules who's exported components, directives or pipes
  are needed by this modules component templates. Don't import anything this module does not need. Importing a
  module does not provide access to its imported modules. Hmm, let's look at that with a picture. Here we have
  AppModule which declares the ProductList-Component, and a SharedModule that declares and exports the
  StarComponent. AppModule imports the SharedModule so the SharedModule's exports are available to the AppModule's
  component templates. This mean that the ProductList-Component can use the StarComponent directive. If the
  SharedModule imports FormsModule then the FormsModule's exports are available to the SharedModule, and the
  StarComponent could use the ngModel directive, but the FormsModule exports are not available to the AppModule. So
  the ProductList-Component could not use the ngModel directive. I've heard this role also stated another way,
  imports are not inherited. Note however, that if the SharedModule re-exported the FormsModule then the FormsModule
  exports are available to the AppModule, and the ProductList-Component could use the ngModel directive. So when
  thinking about the relationship between modules think of a module more as a box than as a tree structure. </p>
<h3>Providers Array</h3>
<p>Angular modules can also register service providers for our application. We can register services we develop such
  as the ProductService we created earlier in this course. The products array of the NgModule decorator allows us
  register service providers at the module level. This is similar to the providers array of the component decorator
  that allows us to register services at the component level. We call that at this point our sample application
  registers the ProductService provider at the component level, and the ProductDetailGuard at the module level. Here
  are some things to keep in mind when using the NgModule providers array. Any service provider added to the
  providers array is registered at the root of the application. So the service is available to be injected into any
  class on the application. Say for example we have a feature module called ProductModule, we add the ProductService
  to the providers array of this module. At first glance we may think we have encapsulated the ProductService into
  the ProductModule, but that is not the case. Any service provider added to the providers array is registered at
  the root of the application, and is available to any class. Even classes in other feature modules. So if we want
  to ensure a particular service is encapsulated and only accessible within a specific component or set of
  components, add the service provider to the providers array of an appropriate component instead of an Angular
  module. Note that this is not the case for lazy loaded services. See the Angular documentation for more
  information on lazy loading. Don't add services to the providers array of a shared module. As discussed in the
  services independencey injection module, there should only be one instance of a service that is an application
  wide singleton. So a service should not be included in the providers array for any module that is meant to be
  shared. Instead consider building a CoreModule for services and importing it once in the AppModule. This will help
  ensure that the the services are only registered one time. We could even add code to the code modules constructor
  to ensure that it is never imported a second time. See the Angular documentation for details. Routing guards must
  be added to the providers array of an Angular module. We discussed this in an earlier course model when adding
  guards to routes. The guard service provider must be defined at the module level so that the router can use these
  services during the navigation process. Now that we've covered the basics of the NgModule decorator let's refactor
  our application into multiple Angular modules.</p>
<h3>Feature Modules</h3>
<p>So far in this course we created the root application module, AppModule. It declares all of our components and
  our pipe. It imports the system Angular modules that our components need. It also registers the routing guard that
  we built, but this is getting a little unwieldy. We have no separation of responsibilities. Here we are mixing our
  basic application features such as the WelcomeComponent, with our product features such as the product components,
  with our shared features such as the StarComponent. As we add more features sets to this application such as
  customer management, invoicing and so on, this is only going to get harder to manage. So lets organize and
  refactor to break this into multiple Angular modules. The first thing we want to do is extract some of these
  pieces into feature sets, we can then create a feature module for each feature set. Using feature modules helps us
  partition our application into logical groupings with separate concerns. Our first step is to define a new feature
  module. Creating a feature module involves defining a new module file, ProductModule in this example, and
  reorganizing the pieces of the application so that all of the associated feature pieces and everything they need
  are here in this module. In the declarations array of the features module we add the appropriate components that
  provide the features for the application. In this example we add the ProductList-Component and
  ProductDetail-Component. Then as we did we the box example at the beginning of this course module, we start to
  look at what each component needs. In this example the ProductList-Component uses the ProductFilterPipe so we need
  that. And both the ProductList and ProductDetail components use the StarComponent so we'll need that here as well.
  But that's not enough, the ProductList-Component uses ngModel and ngFor, and both components use ngIf and routing.
  How do we get that? We import these needed capabilities from other Angular modules. Our product components use
  routing so we import the system RouterModule. The ProductList-Component use ngModel so we import the systems
  FormsModule. And we need ngFor and ngIf, so do pull in the system BrowserModule? Nope, the BrowserModule should
  only be imported into the root application module, AppModule. Instead we import the system CommonModule. The
  CommonModule exposes the ngFor and ngIf directives. Not surprisingly the BrowserModule itself actually imports and
  exports the CommonModule which is why we have access to ngFor and ngIf When we import BrowserModule in our
  AppModule. Lastly we add any related services we want to declare at the module level which make the services
  available to be injected into any class in the application. In this example we add the ProductService and the
  ProductDetailGuard which must be at the module level. So even though these module level services are available
  application wide, we include them in ProductModule and not the AppModule to keep the code better organized and
  easier to find. Our feature module is looking pretty good here, but how do we use it? Now that we've removed these
  features from the root application module, how will the application find all of these features? What's that,
  imports array did you say? That's correct, we need to import the ProductModule into the AppModule. That extends
  the AppModule with the ProductModule features. You want to try this out? We are back in the sample application.
  Let's begin by adding a new file for the ProductModule. We'll add it to the products folder and name it
  product.module.ts. We start with a class. We add the NgModule decorator and the required import statement. We add
  the declarations array and in that array we add the ProductList-Component, ProductDetail-Component and
  ProductFilterPipe. We also need the StarComponent. All those red squigglys? Yeah, we need some import
  statement. Now we can remove these from the app module. Next we define the imports array. We'll add the
  FormsModule, CommonModule and RouterModule, and their associated import statement. Now we can remove the
  FormsModule from the AppModule and it's associated import statement. When we added the RouterModule to the imports
  array in the AppModule we called forRoot to pass in the configured routes for our root component. Now that we are
  adding the RouterModule to the imports array of a feature module, we don't call forRoot. Rather we called forChild
  and there we pass in the routes related to products. Let's cut the product routes from the AppModule, and paste
  them here in our ProductModule. And we need to import the ProductDetailGuard. We call that the
  RouterModule. Registers the Router service provider, declares the router directives, and exposes our configured
  routes. But as we've discussed previously, we never want to register a service more than once. So when we use
  forRoot to pass in our configured routes, the RouterModule knows to register the router service provider. When we
  use forChild as we did here, the RouterModule knows not to re-register the router service. Note that we could also
  consider moving the routes into their own modules. We'll look at that a little later. Lastly, we add the providers
  array. We add the ProductService and ProductDetailGuard to that array, and insert their appropriate import
  statements. Now we can remove the ProductDetailGuard and its import statement from AppModule. Let's remove some
  our remaining import statements, and the ProductService from the app components providers array. Moving the
  ProductService to the ProductModule is optional, we could leave it in the app components providers array. Now, do
  you think our application will run? Our welcome page comes up, but clicking on the Product List option does not
  display the Product List page. Any idea what could be wrong? We know have this ProductModule, but our application
  which is bootstrapped with the AppModule, doesn't know anything about this new module. We have to import this
  module in our AppModule. So here we add the import statement and add the ProductModule to the imports array. Now
  we should be good to go. And our application works as expected. So we now have our first working feature module,
  but let's think about this for a moment. As we build our application we'll build more features. Each logical set
  of features will have their own feature module, and each feature module will most likely need the CommonModule for
  common directives such as ngFor and ngIf. The FormsModule for ngModel and two way binding, and we may have other
  features that want to reuse our StarComponent. Do we really want to repeat all of this in each feature
  module? There has to be a better way. Yep, we can define a shared module. </p>
<h3>Shared Module</h3>
<p>The purpose of a shared module is to organize a set of commonly used pieces into one module, and export those
  pieces so they are available to any module that imports the shared module. This allows us to selectively aggregate
  our reusable components and any external modules, and re-export them in consolidated convenience module. Creating
  a shared module involves defining a new module file, SharedModule in this example, and reorganizing the pieces of
  the application so that the shared pieces are here in this module. First we add the components, directives, and
  pipes that we want to share throughout our application to the declarations array. In this example we only want to
  add the StarComponent. Then we add to the imports array anything that the shared component needs. In this example
  we import the CommonModule because our StarComponent may need it. We don't import FormsModule because we don't
  need it here. If our StarComponent did use two way binding or we added another component here that did, we'd need
  to import FormsModule as well. We then need to export everything that we want to share. The exports array defines
  what this Angular module shares with any module that imports it. We export the StarComponent that way it is
  available to the components in any module that imports the SharedModule. We re-export the CommonModule and
  FormsModule so their directives and other features are available to any module that imports the SharedModule. And
  notice here at we can export something without importing it first. To use the SharedModule we import it into every
  feature module that needs the shared capabilities such as our ProductModule. Let's give this a try. We want to
  build a new shared module. We'll add it to the Shared folder that was provided with the starter files. We'll begin
  by adding a new file and name is shared.module.ts. We'll start with the class and add NgModule decorator, and we
  of course need to import that decorator. Next we define the declarations array and add the appropriate components
  to that array. In our example we'll add the StarComponent, and we'll need it to associate an import statement.
  Next we define the imports array and add the CommonModule and it's associated import statement. Lastly, we define
  what we actually want to share. In the exports array we add CommonModule, FormsModule and StarComponent, and we
  need one more import statement. Now we want to use the SharedModule in our ProductModule. What do we need to
  do? We start by adding the SharedModule to the imports array of the ProductModule, and we need it's import
  statement. We can now delete FormsModule, CommonModule and the StarComponent, and their associated import
  statements here since these pieces are now coming from the imported SharedModule. Are we good to go? Yep, our
  application comes up as it did before. Looking back at our code, notice now that our feature module,
  ProductModule, only contains product pieces and the SharedModule. And the SharedModule is clean, only including
  the pieces we want to share. We can reuse the SharedModule and any future featured modules as we add functionality
  to our application. </p>
<h3>Revisiting AppModule</h3>
<p>We now know that every application has a root application module that is by convention called AppModule. The main
  purpose of the AppModule is to orchestrate the application as a whole. And now that we've removed the feature and
  shared pieces from this module, it's purpose is easier to see. Let's take another look. We've reduced the code and
  AppModule such now that it fits on one page. The AppModule normally imports BrowserModule. This the module that
  ever browser application must import. BrowserModule registers critical application service providers. It also
  imports and exports CommonModule which declares and exports directives such as ngIf and ngFor. These directives
  are then available to any of the app modules component templates. We also import HttpModule to register the
  Angular http client service provider. We import RouterModule and call forRoot passing in the configured routes for
  the root of the application. Here we configure our default route and any wild card routes. Then we import each
  feature module. In this example we have only one feature module, ProductModule. The declarations array identifies
  the list of components that belong to this module. In this example the root component, AppCOmponent, and the
  applications WelcomeComponent, are declared here. The bootstrap array identifies the root component, AppComponent,
  as the bootstrap component. When Angular launches the application it loads this component and displays it's
  template inside the PM app directive in the index.html file. We could take the refactoring a step further and
  separate the routing into it's own module. We could create one Angular module for our root application routes, and
  another Angular module for our product feature routes. Let's go back to the slides and see what that code would
  look like. If we wanted to refactor our root application routes into their own module this is what it might look
  like. We export a class, add the NgModule decorator, and import what we need. We add the RouterModule to the
  imports array passing in our root application routes including our default route and our wild card route. Notice
  that we call forRoot here to ensure that register the routing service provider, and the export RouterModule so we
  can use it from any module that imports this module. We import the AppRoutingModule and the AppModule here. We can
  do the same to refactor our product feature routes into their own module. The key difference here is when we
  import RouterModule in any feature module, we pass the configured routes to the forChild method instead of the
  forRoot method. This ensures that we don't register the routing service provider a second time. And we import this
  ProductRoutingModule into ProductModule as shown here. Now let's finish up this course module with some checklists
  and a summary. </p>
<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
<p>Your application architecture depends on many factors including the size and scope of the application you are
  working on, your team's size and experience, and your project's goals. But here are some suggestions based on what
  we covered in this course module. Every application must always have a root application module by convention
  called AppModule. This is normally the module that bootstraps the root application component, AppComponent. For
  smaller applications this could be the only Angular module for the application, as was the case with out simple
  application prior to this course module. As the application gets more features considering define a separate
  Angular module for each feature set. For example, a product module, a customer module, and an invoice module. This
  keeps the code organized, separates the concerns, and prevents the app module from getting excessively large and
  unwieldy. As you add feature modules you may find components, pipes and directives that you want to share across
  feature modules. Define one or more SharedModules for these shared pieces. SharedModules primarily use the exports
  and declarations arrays with most of the declared pieces exported as well. If you have a set of services that you
  want to ensure are loaded when the application is loaded consider defining a core module for those services. Be
  sure that the core module is imported only once in the root application module. Since the core module is for
  services they primarily have providers, none of which are exported. We did not create a core module for our sample
  application since our service needs are limited, but you may find them useful for your applications. And as we
  discussed in the last clip, we can also refactor our routes into their own routing modules. When creating an
  Angular module we build create a class and decorate it with the NgModule decorator. The NgModule Metadata includes
  the bootstrap array for defining the list of startup components. In many cases there is only one, the root
  component of the application. The declarations array declares which components, directives and pipes belong to
  this module. The exports array identifies the list of components, directives and pipes that an importing module
  can use. The imports array lists supporting modules. These modules provide components, directives and pipes needed
  by the components in this module. The providers array lists the service providers. Angular registers each provider
  with Angular's root application injector. So these services are available to be injected into any class in the
  application. This course module was all about Angular modules. We took a second look at the definition and purpose
  of an Angular module. We then focused in on the Angular module Metadata and covered the truths to keep in mind
  when using that Metadata. We leveraged that knowledge to create a feature module for our application, and took it
  one step further defining a shared module to reduce duplication in our application. Lastly, we re-examined our
  root application route Angular module and saw how it orchestrates the application as a whole. If you are building
  a small application, such as the sample application we've created in this course, you may only need the one route
  application model as shown here, but as your application grows you'll want to refactor into feature models and
  shared modules like this. Here we organized our application into multiple modules. We have our feature module,
  ProductModule, that encapsulates all the product features. There will be more feature modules as our application
  grows. We have our SharedModule that shares commonly used components, directives, and pipes with any module that
  imports it. Currently we import it into the ProductModule. As build more feature modules we'll import it into them
  as well. And we have our AppModule that orchestrates the application. Each feature module is added to the
  AppModule's imports array to extend the application with those features. Ooo, it's been quite a journey. Now let's
  circle back to the beginning. When we set up Angular in the First Things First module we skipped over the
  explanation of the set up files. Next up, let's revisit the Angular set up process and look at these boiler played
  files. What they are, how to use them, and when you'll want to change them. </p>
