<h2>Final Words</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>You now have the basics you need to build Reactive forms. Welcome back to Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from
    Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and the final words in this course include a recap of our journey, and a few
    pointers to additional information. Let's jump right in to the short module.</p>

<h3>Recapping Your Journey</h3>

<p>Template-driven or Reactive forms? To help you make that decision, we looked at the similarities and differences
    between these two choices for building data entry forms with Angular. As we covered in this course, these are some
    of the key advantages of a template-driven approach, and these are some of the reasons to go with a Reactive forms
    approach. Depending on your team, its experience, and its background, some of these factors may weigh more heavily
    than others. Select the appropriate forms approach that works best for you, your team, and your project. As you saw
    throughout this course, Reactive forms shifts the responsibility from managing our form and its data from the
    template to the component class. Instead of the template automatically generating the form model to track form and
    input element state, we build the form model ourselves in our component class using FormBuilder, the template then
    binds to our form model. Instead of using two-way data binding to automatically keep the class properties and user
    entries in sync, we can define an immutable data model, and explicitly manage the form data. Since the class
    properties are in sync with the form data in the template-drive approach, when it comes time to save, we just save
    the class properties. With Reactive forms, we combine the class properties and the user's changes retained by the
    form model to specify the data to save. Because we build the form model and manage the data ourselves, we have more,
    more functionality, more flexibility, and more control of our forms and their associated data, and as we've seen in
    this course, more code. With Reactive forms we define right and wrong by setting validation rules when building the
    form model, but we can easily change those rules at run time. In the demo form, we set the phone number as required,
    only if the user requested notification by text message. So we can handle validation rules that specify right,
    wrong, or it depends. I see you. By watching the user's changes we can react to modify the display, the validation,
    or the messages, providing a much more dynamic and personal experience. In the demo form, we walked through how to
    watch for changes to the email input element. When the value changed, we checked the element state, and displayed
    validation error messages when appropriate. Moving the validation error messages and their logic to the component
    class greatly simplified our template HTML. We then tried out the debounceTime reactive transformation, to allow the
    user to enter an entire value before displaying a validation error message. Sometimes a single entry is not enough,
    the user may want to enter multiple address blocks or multiple search tags. We examined how to use a FormArray to
    dynamically duplicate input elements on the form using the Reactive forms approach. We then looked at how to fit the
    form piece into the context of a more full-featured application. We saw how to navigate to a form, and set up a
    route guard to remind the user to save before navigating away, and we set up validation for reuse. Lastly, we
    examined the code for a Data Access Service to create, read, update, and delete form data on a back-end server using
    HTTP. Along the way, this course provided a set of checklists containing steps and tips. Feel free to revisit and
    reference these checklists as you start building your own Reactive forms applications.</p>

<p>If you want more information about Angular components, services, dependency injection, or observables, check out one
    of these beginner level courses. To learn more about template-drive forms, check out this course. And the Angular
    documentation covers both template-driven and Reactive forms, it's a great reference.</p>

<h3>Closing</h3>

<p>Congratulations, you now know how to build Angular Reactive forms with full CRUD support, yay. Only one question
    remains, right or left? Thanks for listening, and I'd love to hear about your experience with Angular forms.</p>
