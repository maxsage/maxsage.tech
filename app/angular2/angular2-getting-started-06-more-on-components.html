    <h2>More on Components</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>When building clean components, we want to ensure everything is strongly typed, our styles are encapsulated, we
      respond to appropriate lifecycle events, and we transform data to user-friendly values as needed. Welcome back to
      Angular 2: Getting Started, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in this module, we learn several ways
      to improve upon our components. Components are one of the key building blocks of our application. The cleaner,
      stronger, and more durable we make these blocks, the better are our application. So, how can we make our
      components better? Strong typing helps minimize errors through better syntax checking and improved tooling. But
      what if there is no pre-defined type for a property? To strongly type a property that has no pre-defined type, we
      define the type ourselves using an interface. If a component needs special styles, we can encapsulate those styles
      within the component to ensure they don't leak out to any other component in the application. A component has a
      lifecycle managed by Angular. Angular provides a set of lifecycle hooks we can use to tap into key points in that
      lifecycle, adding flexibility and responsiveness to our application. As we saw in the last module, pipes provide a
      convenient way to transform bound data before displaying it in the view. But Angular doesn't have built-in pipes
      for sorting or filtering iterable lists. And we may have other application-unique data transformation
      requirements. Luckily, we can build our own custom pipes. Our components often refer to external template and
      stylesheet files. We reference these files in the component meta data using an absolute path from the application
      root. We can instead use a component relative path approach if we set module Ids. In this module, we explain
      interfaces and demonstrate how to use them to strongly type our objects. We look at how to encapsulate component
      styles. We introduce the component lifecycle and how hook into its events. We detail how to build a custom pipe.
      And we see how to change to relative paths by setting the module Id. Looking at our Application Architecture, in
      this module we'll add features to improve the product list component. Let's get started.</p>
    <h3>Defining Interfaces</h3>
    <p>One of the benefits of using TypeScript is that strong typing. Every property has a type, every method has a
      return type, and every method parameter has a type. This strong typing helps minimize errors through better syntax
      checking and tooling. In some cases however, we have a property or method that does not have a pre-defined type,
      such as our products array here. We defined our products array as any, which negates the benefits of strong
      typing. To specify custom types, we can define an interface. An interface is a specification identifying a related
      set of properties and methods. A class commits to supporting the specification by implementing the interface. That
      means the class includes code for each property and method identified in the interface. We can then use the
      interface as a data type. ES 5 and ES 2015 do not support interfaces, but TypeScript does. So interfaces are
      transpiled out and are not found in the resulting JavaScript. This means that interfaces are development time
      only. Their purpose is to provide strong typing and better tooling support as we build, debug, and maintain our
      code. Here is an example of a TypeScript interface. We define an interface using the interface keyword, followed
      by the interface name, which is often the name of the business object that the interface describes. By many naming
      conventions, the interface is prefixed with an I for interface, though some TypeScript developers leave off this
      prefix. The export keyword here at the front exports this interface, thereby making it available for use anywhere
      in the application. The body of the interface defines the set of properties and methods appropriate for this
      business object. For each property, the interface includes the property name, a colon, and the property data
      type. For each method, the interface includes the method name, the list of parameters along with their data types,
      a colon, and the method return type. To use the interface as a data type, we import the interface, then use the
      interface name as the data type. Looks easy enough. Let's try it out. We back in the sample application, looking
      at the product list component. Here, we see that we defined our products array as any. So let's create an
      interface that defines what a product is. We'll put the interface into its own file in the products folder. We'll
      name that file product.ts, after the business object it defines. We first type the export keyword to ensure the
      other parts of the application can use this interface. That is, after all, why we are creating it. Next, we type
      in the interface keyword. Then, the name of the interface. I like to use the I prefix to distinguish the interface
      from the business object. And we are defining a product, so Iproduct. Inside the interface, we define the
      properties and methods appropriate for the business object. For our sample application, we only need properties.
      For each property, we define the property name, a colon, and the type of the property. Notice that we are typing
      the release date as a string. If we later work with this value as the date object, we could change this type to a
      date. That's it, that's all we have to do to define an interface. Now we can use this interface as our data type
      in the product list component. Before we do though, let's try something. Let's introduce a typographical error
      into our products array. No error is detected. We won't even know we made a mistake until we see the application
      in the browser. And we notice that no image is displayed for one of the products. As you can imagine, these kinds
      of errors could cause hard to find bugs. Now let's replace the any with Iproduct. We get a syntax error. What did
      we miss? Yep, we need an import. And, bang. Now that our array of products is strongly typed, we are notified that
      we made an error in our product array property. We don't even have to view it in the browser to see that something
      is amiss. So this is a good demonstration of one of the benefits of strong typing. Let's fix that error. Notice
      that we get intellisense now for these properties. Another great benefit of strong typing. Let's check this out in
      the browser. Now everything works as it did. In our interface file, we could define a class for the product
      business object here as well. Something like this. In general, we only create a business object class if that
      class provides some functionality that we want to use throughout our application, such as this calculate discount
      method. And if we think we might want to create a business object at some point in the future, then we definitely
      want to add the I prefix to our interface. But for our sample application, we don't need any product methods. So
      we don't really need a product class. We will use this interface throughout the application to strongly type our
      products. Before we move on, let's make one change. Notice that we're getting lots of files here. Unless we want
      to look at them, we really don't need to open the .js or .map files. Let's hide them from the editor. In VS code,
      we do that by selecting file, preferences, workspace settings. I'll paste exclude entries for the .js and .map
      files. Now we see that the .js and .map files don't appear in the explorer window here on the left. And we can
      more easily find the files we need to edit. Neat! Next, let's look at encapsulating component styles. </p>
    <h3>Encapsulating Component Styles</h3>
    <p>When we build the template for a component, we sometimes need styles unique to that template. For example, if we
      build a sidebar navigation component, we may want special li or div elements styles. When we nest a component that
      requires special styles within a container component, we need a way to bring in those unique styles. One option is
      to define those styles directly in the template's HTML. But that makes it harder to see, reuse, and maintain those
      styles. Another options is to define the styles in an external stylesheet. That makes them easier to maintain, but
      that puts the burden on the container component to ensure the external stylesheet is linked in the
      index.html. That makes our nested component somewhat more difficult to reuse. But there is a better way. To help
      us out with this issue, the component decorator has properties to encapsulate styles as part of the component
      definition. These properties are styles and styleUrls. We add unique styles directly to the component using the
      styles property. This property is an array so we can add multiple styles separated by commas. A better solution is
      to create one or more external stylesheets and identify them with the styleUrls property. This property is an
      array so we can add multiple stylesheets separated by commas. By encapsulating the styles within the component,
      any defined selectors or style classes are only applicable to the component's template and won't leak out into any
      other part of the application. Let's try this out. Before we change any code, let's look again at our product list
      view in the browser. Notice the table headers. They could use a little color. So let's build an external
      stylesheet for our product list component. We'll add a new file in the products folder, and since this file only
      contains the styles for our product list component, we'll call it product-list.component.css. In this stylesheet
      we add a table header style. We can modify the t head element styles directly, because the stylesheet is
      encapsulated in this component. And the styles defined here won't affect any other component in the
      application. We could add any other styles as needed to jazz up our product list component. To use this new
      stylesheet, we modify the product list component. In the component decorator, we specify our unique stylesheet. We
      add the styleUrls property and pass it in array. In the first element to the array, we specify the path to our
      stylesheet. Note that the style path is relative to the index.html file. We could add more stylesheets here,
      separated with commas. Let's review the result in the browser. And we see that the table header is now a nice,
      blue color. We can use the styles or styleUrls property of the component decorator anytime we want to encapsulate
      unique styles for our component. Next up, let's dive into lifecycle hooks.</p>
    <h3>Using Lifecycle Hooks</h3>
    <p>A component has a lifecycle, managed by Angular. Angular creates the component, renders it, creates and renders
      its children, processes changes when its data-bound properties change, and then destroys it before removing its
      template from the DOM. Angular provides a set of lifecycle hooks we can use to tap into this lifecycle and perform
      operations as needed. Since this is a getting started course, we'll limit our focus to the three most commonly
      used lifecycle hooks. Use the OnInit lifecycle hook to perform any component initialization after Angular has
      initialized the data-bound properties. This is a good place to retrieve the data for the template from a back-end
      service, as we'll see later in this course. Use the OnChanges lifecycle hook to perform any action after Angular
      sets data-bound input properties. We have not yet covered input properties. We'll see those in the next module.
      Use the OnDestroy lifecycle hook to perform any cleanup before Angular destroys the component. To use a lifecycle
      hook, we implement the lifecycle hook interface. We talked about interfaces earlier in this module. Since Angular
      itself is written in TypeScript, it provides several interfaces we can implement, including one interface for each
      lifecycle hook. For example, the interface for the OnInit lifecycle hook is OnInit. Notice that it is not prefixed
      with an I. We are using the OnInit interface from Angular, so any guesses as to our next step? Yep, we need to
      import the lifecycle hook interface. We can then write the hook method. Each lifecycle hook interface defines one
      method whose name is the interface name prefixed with ng for Angular. For example, the OnInit interface hook
      method is named ngOnInit. Our first step here of implementing the interface is actually optional. Recall from our
      discussion of interfaces earlier in the module that neither ES 5 nor ES 2015 support interfaces. They are features
      of TypeScript. That means that the interfaces are transpiled out of the resulting JavaScript. So we don't really
      have to implement the interface to use lifecycle hooks. We can simply write code for the hook method. However, it
      is good practice, and provides better tooling, when we implement the interface. At this point in our application,
      we don't need to implement any lifecycle hooks, but we'll use them in later modules. So let's try them out now. We
      are looking at the product list component. We'll add the OnInit lifecycle hook to this component. First, we
      implement the interface by adding it to the class signature. Type implements and the name of the interface,
      OnInit. The interface name is showing an error and we know why. We don't have the import. Let's add that
      now. Since OnInit is also imported from Angular Core, we simply add it to our first import statement by typing a
      comma and OnInit. Now we have another syntax error here. Class product list component incorrectly implements
      interface OnInit. As the message states, now that we've implemented the interface, we must write code for every
      property and method in that interface. The OnInit interface only defines one method, ngOnInit. So we need to write
      the code for the ngOnInit method. We'll add it down here by the other methods. Since we don't really need to do
      anything with this at this point, we'll just use console.log to log a message to the console. We can view the
      application in the browser and use the F12 developer tools to open the console and view the logged message. We can
      see our message here. We'll use ngOnInit later in this course. Up next, we'll build a custom pipe. </p>
    <h3>Building Custom Pipes</h3>
    <p>As we saw in the last module, we use pipes for transforming bound properties before displaying them in a view.
      There are built-in pipes that transform a single value or an iterable list of data.>We covered these in the last
      module. In this module, we want to build our own custom pipe. The code required to build a custom pipe may look
      somewhat familiar at this point. It uses patterns similar to other code we've created in this course. Here is the
      class. We implement a PipeTransform interface, which has one method, transform. We write code in the transform
      method to transform a value and return it. The first parameter of the transform method is the value we are
      transforming. In this example, we transform an array of products into a filtered array of products. Notice that we
      are using the Iproduct interface to strongly type the array that's passed in. That is the interface we created
      earlier in this module. The second parameter here is for any arguments we need to perform the transformation. In
      our case, we want to pass in the filter criteria entered by the user. The method return type is also defined as an
      array of products, because we are returning the filtered array of products. We add a pipe decorator to the class
      to define it as a pipe. Similar to the other decorators we've used, this is a function so we add parentheses. We
      pass an object to the function specifying the name of the pipe. This is the name for the pipe used in the
      template, as we'll see shortly. And of course, we have our imports to import what we need. Notice how similar this
      looks to the components we've created in this course? Angular provides a very consistent coding experience. To use
      a custom pipe in a template, simply add a pipe and the pipe name. Include any arguments required by the
      transformation, separated by colons. But of course, that is not enough. We also need to tell Angular where to find
      this pipe. We add the pipe to an Angular module. How do we know which Angular module? At this point, that's easy
      because we only have one, AppModule. But if we had multiple modules, we'd add it to the module that declares the
      component that needs the pipe. In our example, the product list component template needs the pipe. So we add the
      declaration to the same Angular module that declares the product list component. We define the pipe in the
      declarations array of the NgModule decorator. Now lets build our custom pipe and filter our list of products.
      Since our custom pipe is currently designed to only filter products, we'll add it to the products folder. We'll
      create a new file and call it product-filter.pipe.ts, following our naming conventions. We'll start by writing the
      code for the class. Export, so we can import this pipe where we need it. Class, and the class name. We'll call it
      product filter pipe. We want to implement the pipe transform interface, so we add that here. The syntax error
      is because we don't have the import statement. So let's add that next. We still have a syntax error, because when
      we implement the pipe transform interface, we are required to implement every property and method defined in that
      interface. For the pipe transform interface, there is only one method, transform. Notice, right away that we have
      yet another syntax error. We are defining the value parameter to be an array of Iproduct. But we have not yet
      imported that interface. So let's do that now. And we can add a return statement to get rid of this last syntax
      error. Next, we need to decorate the class with the pipe decorator. Here, we specify the pipe's name. And we'll
      add pipe to our import statement. Now it's time to implement the transform method. I'll pace the code so that we
      can talk through it, but don't worry if you haven't seen some of the syntax before. This is mostly JavaScript and
      is not critical for learning Angular. But what does this code do? Our goal is to transform the passed list of
      products to a filtered list based on a user-entered filter string. This first line of code uses a JavaScript
      conditional operator to handle the possibility that no filterBy string was defined. If there is a filterBy, this
      code converts it to lowercase. Why convert it to lowercase? So we can compare apples to apples when we filter the
      product list. We want a case insensitive comparison. If there is no filterBy, this code sets the filterBy to
      null. Then we return the filtered list of products. Let's break this down. This code also uses the JavaScript
      conditional operator. If our filter variable has a true value, meaning that it is defined and not null, then we
      filter the list. Otherwise, there was no filter specified and we return the original value, which is our full list
      of products. Let's look closer at this filter statement. We are using the array filter method to create a new
      array with elements that pass the test defined in the provided function. We're using the ES 2015 arrow syntax to
      define that filter function. For each product in the list, the product name is converted to lowercase and the
      IndexOf is used to determine if the filtered text is found in the product name. If so, the element is added to the
      filtered list. See the MDN entry for filter at this link for more information on the array filter function. Now we
      are ready to use our pipe in the product list component. We'll filter the list of products here. In our ngfor
      clause, we'll add the pipe character and the name of our pipe, productFilter. Be sure to insert within the
      quotes. We also need to pass in our pipe argument. In this example, we pass in the listfilter property. That
      property contains the value the user entered in the filterBy input box. Let's give this a try. Oh, our page did
      not display. And using the F12 tools, we can see why. The pipe, productFilter, could not be found. What did we
      forget? Recall from the slides that we need to tell Angular about our new pipe. We do that by declaring the pipe
      in an Angular module. Our product list components template wants to use the productFilter pipe. So we open the
      Angular module that declares the ProductListComponent, which is our app module. We then add ProductFilterPipe to
      the declarations array. And we import the ProductFilterPipe. Now any component declared in App module can use our
      product filter pipe. Are we ready to see the result? Our default filter is cart, so now we only see the garden
      cart. Change the filter, and we see different entries. It's working! Not too shabby, not too shabby at all! So to
      create a custom pipe, we built a class, implemented the pipe transform interface, and decorated the class with the
      pipe decorator. To use the pipe in a template, we specify a pipe character, the pipe name, and any pipe
      arguments. And we declare the pipe in the Angular module's declarations array. Next up, let's look at how we can
      replace the absolute paths in our components with relative paths. </p>
    <h3>Relative Paths with Module Id</h3>
    <p>Our components often refer to external template and stylesheet files. We reference these files in the component
      metadata, using an absolute path from the application root. As an example, here is our product list component. We
      specify the location to the template with an absolute path from the application root, which is the location of the
      index.html file. Because of our folder structure, our path is app/products. We use the same absolute path for the
      location of our stylesheet file. There are several downsides to using absolute paths. They make it harder to
      adjust our folder structure over time as the application grows. They make it harder to reuse our components in
      other applications. And some tools, such as the ahead of time compiler that we'll discuss later in this course,
      require component relative paths. So what do we do? We can instead use a component relative path approach if we
      set moduleId. Here we set the component's module Id, so we can change to component relative URLs. What is this
      module id? The module id is a semi-global variable that is available when using the CommonJS module format. It
      contains the absolute URL of the component class module file. Using module id requires that we write our modules
      in the CommonJS format. We are writing our modules in CommonJS format as we've defined in our tsconfig.jason file.
      We'll discuss this file more in the Angular 2 Set-up Revisited module later in this course. Using module.id also
      requires that we use a module loader, such as SystemJS. We saw in the First Things First module, at the beginning
      of this course, that we are indeed using the SystemJS module loader. So we are all set up such that we can use
      module.ids. Let's give this a try. Here, in our product list component, we'll add the module.id property to the
      component decorator. Then we can remove the absolute paths from both the template URL and the style URL. Running
      the application, we can see that it still works. And if we look at the command window, we see that Angular
      determined the appropriate full path for us. Specify a module.id anytime you want to use component relative paths
      for the template and stylesheet URLs. Note that the sample code in this course uses absolute paths and no
      module.ids, just to keep the code simple. Feel free to add module.ids and use component relative paths if
      desired. Now let's finish up this module with some checklists we can use as we work more with components. </p>
    <h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
    <p>We've covered several discrete topics in this module, so we have a checklist for each one. First, interfaces. We
      use interfaces to specify custom types, such as product in our sample application. Interfaces are a great way to
      promote strong typing in our applications. When creating an interface, use the interface keyword in the body of
      the interface to find the appropriate properties and methods along with their types. And don't forget to export
      the interface, so it can be used anywhere in our application. We implement an interface, including built-in
      Angular interfaces, to ensure that our class defines every property and method identified in that interface. Add
      the implement's keyword and the interface name to the class signature. Then be sure to write code for every
      property and method in the interface. Otherwise, TypeScript displays a syntax error. We can encapsulate the styles
      for our component in the component itself. That way the styles required for the component are associated with the
      component alone and don't leak into any other parts of the application. Use the styles property of the component
      decorator to specify the template styles as an array of strings. Use the styleUrls property of the component
      decorator to identify an array of external stylesheet paths. The specified styles are then encapsulated in the
      component. Lifecycle hooks allow us to tap into a component's lifecycle to perform operations. The steps for using
      a lifecycle hook are import the lifecycle hook interface, implement the lifecycle hook interface in the component
      class. This step is not required, but highly recommended. Then, write the code for the hook method defined in the
      lifecycle hook interface. To build a custom pipe, import Pipe and PipeTransform. Create a class that implements
      the PipeTransform interface. This interface has one method, transform. Be sure to export the class so the pipe can
      be imported from other components. Write code in the Transform method to perform the needed transformation. And
      decorate the class with Pipe decorator. We can use a Custom Pipe in any template, anywhere we can specify a pipe.
      In an Angular module, import the pipe. In the meta data, declare the pipe in the declarations array. Then any
      template associated with a component declared in that Angular module, can use that pipe. In a template,
      immediately after the property to transform, type a pipe character, specify the pipe name, and enter the pipe
      arguments, if any, separated by colons. Our components often refer to external template and stylesheet files. To
      use a component relative path when specifying template URL and style URLs, set moduleids. Set the moduleid
      property of the component decorator to module.id. Then change each Url to a component-relative path in the
      templateUrl or styleUrl properties. This module provided a set of techniques for improving our components. We
      walked through how to use an interface to strongly type our custom objects. We saw how to encapsulate styles
      within a component. We were introduced to the component lifecycle and how to tap into that lifecycle with
      lifecycle hooks. And we discovered how to build a Custom Pipe that we can use in any component template. We also
      saw how to change to relative paths by setting the Module Id. So in this module, we've completed the Product List
      Component. Yay!>Next up, we'll see how to build nested components and build this Star Component.</p>
