<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>We can build forms in Angular 2 with a template-driven approach using HTML and data binding, or we can build Reactive
    forms using a model-driven approach by defining the form model and validation in our component code. Welcome to
    Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and this course provides the concepts you
    need to build Reactive forms, validate user-entered data, and save that data using HTTP. We've all filled out our
    share of online forms. Register for an event, fill out a form. Make a dentist appointment, fill out a form. And
    often our company runs on online forms, forms for tracking our time, forms for booking conference rooms, forms for
    managing inventory, and so on. In this introductory module, we start with a short overview of forms in Angular. We
    consider several suggestions for getting the most from this course. We explore the demo form and sample application
    that we will use in this course, and we look at the topics we'll cover in the remainder of this course. Okay then,
    let's get started.</p>

<h3>Angular Forms</h3>

<p>When we build a form with Angular, we always create a component class for the form logic, and a template for the
    form's user interface. If the form updates data, the component class calls a service to retrieve existing data from
    a database or other data store on a server somewhere, and that data is displayed as default values on the form. We
    then collect user entries, validating the data as the user types. If needed, we display validation messages back to
    the user. When the user submits the form, the component class calls a service to pass the validated data back to the
    database or other data store on the server, and the user's entries or updates are saved. How do we build the
    template and component class for our forms? Angular provides two techniques for building forms, template-driven and
    Reactive, previously called model-driven. Both techniques share the same basic concepts, but as its name implies,
    template-driven forms put the responsibility for the forms squarely in the template, which we define with basic HTML
    and data binding. Reactive forms shift much of that responsibility to the component class. We still create the
    template with HTML, but we manage the data and validation in the component code. Let's take a high level look at the
    strengths of each technique. There are many advantages to building forms using a template-driven approach. The
    template-driven technique is straightforward and easy to use, and it looks very familiar if you've built forms with
    Angular 1. Because template-driven forms rely heaving on two-way data binding, we don't have to write any code to
    copy the data to the input elements, or track the user's entries, it's all handled automatically. Speaking of
    automatically, Angular also automatically tracks form and input element state. We can use this state information to
    determine when the form is invalid and disable the Save button, for example. With much more of the logic for our
    form in our class, Reactive forms provide more flexibility, they handle more complex validation scenarios, such as
    changing validation based on a user's selection or on the form state. Reactive forms do not use data binding, so the
    form cannot mutate our data model. The component code controls how to handle any changes to the data; some
    developers prefer this immutability. Using Reactive forms makes it easier to perform an action on a value change,
    such as transforming the value to uppercase or performing a partial lookup. We have access to reactive
    transformations, such as DebounceTime to delay reacting to user input, and DistinctUntilChanged to ignore values
    that are the same as previously processed values. Reactive forms make it easier to dynamically add input elements to
    the form, so we could allow the user to enter any number of addresses, for example. And since more of the logic and
    validation are in the code, not the template, some developers find that the logic is easier to unit test. There is
    no magic going on under the hood when you work with Reactive forms, everything is direct, there is no template
    between your code and your data structures. The primary issue with Reactive forms, however, is that they require
    more code. Depending on your team, its experience, and its background, some of these factors may weigh more heavily
    than others. It is important to select the appropriate forms approach that works best for you and your team. To help
    you make that decision, we'll dive deeper into their similarities and differences, and examine the code for both
    techniques in the next modules. For now, let's look at some tips for getting the most from this course.</p>

<h3>Get the Most from This Course</h3>

<p>First, the prerequisites. To get the most from this course, it is important that you know the basics of Angular 2.
    This means understanding Angular modules, components, templates, including binding, services, and basic routing. If
    you don't have the requisite knowledge, consider taking one of the introductory Angular 2 courses here on
    Pluralsight, such as Angular 2: Getting Started or Angular 2: First Look. You do not need any prior knowledge of
    Angular forms; we'll cover what you need in this course. Another way to get the most from this course is to join the
    discussion. Thoughts, comments, or questions as you watch this course? Feel free to use the Discussion tab, you can
    find the link to the discussion on the Pluralsight page for this course, or follow me on Twitter. It would be great
    to hear about your experiences with Reactive forms. There is also a blog post specifically for this course at the
    URL shown here. This post identifies common issues along with their solutions. If you have any problems with the
    code for the course, check here first, there may already be a solution posted. When building web applications,
    regardless of the technologies we use, there are lots of steps and places where things can go wrong. That's when a
    good checklist can come in. I'll present checklists at the end of many of the modules, and we'll use them as a brief
    review of what was covered in that module. Feel free to jump ahead to the checklist if you have any problems when
    coding along with the demos, and consider referencing these checklists as you start building your own Angular forms
    applications. Coding along with the demos is another great way to get the most from this course. Though not
    required, it is often helpful to try out the presented code as you navigate through the course. To get you started,
    I've set up a public GitHub repository specifically for this course, it is called Angular2-ReactiveForms, and you
    can find it at this URL. The starter files for the forms demo are here, you can use these files as a starting point
    if you want to code along with the demos. If you'd prefer to follow along with the completed demo form code, you can
    find that here. Toward the end of this course, we'll look at a form in the context of a more full-featured sample
    application; that sample application is here. If you are new to GitHub, simply click this button to download all of
    the code as a zip file. So what's in this code? Let's take a look.</p>

<h3>Demo Form and Sample Application</h3>

<p>We start with a simple demo sign up form built using the template-driven approach. We examine the code, then rebuild
    this form using the Reactive forms approach to understand the key differences between the two techniques. Then we
    add more features, such as custom validation, cross-field validation, and dynamic addition of multiple addresses.
    Later in this course, we'll examine a second Reactive form in the context of a more full-featured Angular
    application. The sample application demonstrates routing to the form, including routing guards, and details the data
    access service to communicate with a back-end server via HTTP to retrieve and save data. Let's see this sample
    application in action. Welcome to Acme Product Management. As its name implies, this application manages our
    company's current list of products. We'll use this application later in this course, when we look at a Reactive form
    in the context of a more full-featured application. This application may look familiar if you have seen the Angular
    2: Getting Started course here on Pluralsight. I've incorporated an edit form, and add, edit, and delete operations
    into the sample application that was built in the Getting Started course. Here at the top is our menu for access to
    the key features of the application. In a real application, there may be more options here, but we want to focus on
    building a Reactive form, so I've limited the application to basic functionality. Clicking on the Product List
    option displays the Product List page. From here we can click the Edit button to edit the product. Clicking on the
    product name navigates to the Product Detail page; we also have an Edit button here. Clicking the Edit button
    displays the Reactive form for editing the selected product. Notice that each of the fields are populated with
    existing values, the user can edit product information, or click Delete to delete the product. If the user makes a
    mistake and breaks one of the validation rules, the application displays a validation error message, and the Save
    button is disabled. Let's enter a new product name. If the users tries to navigate away from the page, we have a
    routing guard to notify them of their unsaved changes. If the user wants more search tags for this product, they can
    click Add Tag. This dynamically duplicates the input elements, the label and input box in this example, so the user
    can add any number of search tags. Clicking Save saves the product and returns to the Product List page where we see
    our updated value. Clicking the Add Product option displays the same form, but initialized for entry of a new
    product. Notice that the Save is disabled until the form values are valid. Once all of the data is valid, clicking
    the Save saves the new product and navigates back to the Product List page. Here we see our new product. So that's
    the basics of a sample application that we'll look at later in this course. Now let's finish up this introductory
    module with a look at the outline for the remainder of this course.</p>

<h3>Course Outline</h3>

<p>In this course, we start with a more detailed look at the similarities and differences between template- driven and
    Reactive forms, including an examination of the building blocks that make up the form model. Next, we build a
    Reactive form, first using the form model building blocks directly, and then using FormBuilder to simplify the code.
    We add validation rules and error messages to validate the user's entries, including custom validation and
    cross-field validation. With Reactive forms, we can adjust how a form works reactively based on user entries and
    selections. For example, based on a user's selection, we can change the form's validation rules. We'll see how to
    watch for user changes and react to those changes. We'll also examine reactive transformations, such as
    DebounceTime. Sometimes a single entry is not enough, the user may need to enter multiple email addresses, or
    multiple address blocks, or multiple search tags. In that case, we can dynamically duplicate input elements. We'll
    see how to do that with Reactive forms and form arrays. Then we switch gears a bit, and examine a Reactive form in
    the context of a more full-featured sample application. We'll look at techniques for routing to the form, setting up
    routing guards, and building reusable custom validation. In many scenarios the key purpose of a form is to collect
    or edit data that is then stored in a database or other data stores somewhere. To do that we need to deal with CRUD,
    or create, read, update, and delete operations for retrieving and saving data to a back-end server with HTTP. By the
    end of this course we'll have a simple, but fully operational Angular application, that includes a Reactive form
    with full CRUD support. You can use this application as a reference for your own development. Let's get started.</p>
