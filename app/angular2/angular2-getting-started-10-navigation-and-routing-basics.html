<h2>Navigation and Routing Basics</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A single view does not an application make. Welcome back to Angular Two, Getting Started from Pluralsight. My
name is Deborah Kurata and in the next two modules we define routes to navigate between multiple views in our
application. Users like to have all of the information they need at their fingertips, so our applications often
provide multiple sets of data in multiple layouts across multiple views. Routing provides a way for the user to
navigate between those many views of the application, whether there are five, 10, or hundreds. In this module, we
start with an overview of how routing works in Angular. We examine how to configure routes and tie routes to
actions and we define where to place the router component's view. Currently, our app component embeds our Product
List Component as a Nested Component. We instead want to define a set of routes so the user can navigate to the
welcome view, product list view, or product detail view. We've already built the Product List Component and I've
provided the Welcome Component with the starter files in the Github Repository for this course. As part of the
demos in this module, we'll build the shell for the Product Detail Component. When we're finished with this
module, we'll have a simple application that routes to multiple views. </p>
<h3>How Routing Works</h3>
<p>An Angular application is a single page application. That means all of our views are displayed within one page,
normally defined in the index.html file. So each of the five, ten, or hundreds of views take turns appearing on
that one page. How do we manage which view to display when? That's the purpose of routing.>We configure a route
for each component that wants to display its view on the page. As part of our application design, we provide a
menu, a toolbar, buttons, images, or data links that allow the user to select the view to display. We tie a route
to each option or action. When the user selects the option or performs the action, the associated route is
activated. Activating a component's route displays that component's view. So for example, the user selects a menu
option to display the product list. The product list route is activated and it displays its view. Hmm, let's look
at that process again with an illustration. Here is the menu that we'll add to our sample application. We tie a
route to each menu option using a built-in router directive called Router Link. When the user clicks on the
product list option for example, the Angular router navigates to the product's route. The browser's location URL
changes to match this path segment and we see slash products appear in the address bar. By default, Angular uses
html five style URLs which don't require the hash symbol to indicate local navigation. By using the hmtl five
style URLs, you need to configure your web server to perform URL rewriting. How this is done depends on your web
server. See the documentation for your web server on how to configure URL rewriting. Angular also supports hash
style routing which does not require URL rewriting. We'll look at how to use hash style routing later in this
module. When the browser's URL changes, the Angular router looks for a route definition matching the path segment,
Products in this example. The route definition includes the component to load when this route is activated. In
this case, the Product List Component. The Angular router loads the components template. Where does it display
this template? Where we specified with the built-in routing directive called Router Outlet and the Product List
appears. So that's how routing works. We'll examine these steps in further detail and try them out in demos as we
journey through this course module. But first, let's add in these two missing components. I provided the Welcome
Component as part of the starter files so we only need to build the Product Detail Component. The Product Detail
Component should ultimately look like this but we want to focus on routing, not building another component, so
let's just create a shell for the Product Detail Component so we can route to it. In the Products folder, create a
new file called Product dash detail dot component dot ts and a new Template called product dash detail dot
component dot html. In the html file, put some placeholder text and use interpellation to bind a page title so
we'll have something to display on the page. We'll see this in action a little later. Now how about the
component? Recall how to build the basics of a component? Consider pausing the video now and creating a first cut
of the Product Detail Component with a page title and product properties. Continue the video when you want to see
my solution. Here's what I came up with for the first cut of the Product Detail Component. We import the component
decorator. We import the I product interface so we can use it as the data type of our product property. We export
the Product Detail Component class. We define properties for the page title and product and we decorate the class
with the component decorator defining our view using template URL. Is this close to what you came up with? Notice
that I don't have a selector property here. The selector property is only required if the component will be nested
within another component and we don't need to nest this component. We'll instead display the component's view as
part of routing. There is one more step here we need to take. Any idea what it might be? Every time we add a
component to the application, we need to declare that component in an Angular module. We currently only have one
Angular module, AppModule. So we'll add the Product Detail and Welcome Component to the declaration's array for
the app module. Let's do that now. Here we are, looking at the app module. We first import the Welcome Component
and the Product Detail Component. Then we add them both to the declarations array. With that, we are ready to add
routing to our application. </p>
<h3>Configuring Routes</h3>
<p>Routing is component-based, so we identify the set of components that we want to provide as routing targets and
define a route for each one. Let's see how this is done. An Angular application has one router that is managed by
Angular's router service and we know that before we can use that service, we need to register the service provider
in an Angular module, similar to the http module, Angular provides a RoutherModule in the Angular router package
that registers the router service provider. To include the features of this external module in our application, we
need to add it to the imports array of our application's Angular module. In addition to registering the router
service provider, the RoutherModule also declares the router directives. In the last clip we mentioned two router
directives, router link and router outlet. By importing the RoutherModule, our component templates can use these
or any other router directive. RoutherModule also exposes the routes we configure. Before we can navigate to a
route, we need to ensure that the routes are available to the application. We do this by passing the routes to
RoutherModule like this. We call the RoutherModules forRoot method and pass our array of routes to that method.
This establishes the routes for the root of our application. If we want to use hash style routes instead of html
five style routes, we change this code to set useHash as shown here. With that, we are ready to configure some
routes. The router must be configured with a list of route definitions. Each definition specifies a route object.
Each route requires a path. The path property defines the URL segment for the route. When this route is activated,
this URL path segment is appended to the URL of our application. The user can type in or bookmark the resulting
URL to return directly to the associated components view. In most cases we also specify a component, which is the
component associated with the route. It is this component's template that is displayed when the route is
activated. These are all examples of route definitions. The first route simply maps a specific URL path segment to
a specific component. So this URL displays the template from the Product List Component. The colon ID in the
second route represents a route parameter. The Product Detail Page displays the detail for one product so it needs
to know which product to display. The Product Detail Component reads the ID from this path segment and displays
the defined product. We can define any number of parameters here separated wit slashes. What does this route
do? Yep, this URL displays the template from the Welcome Component. This one defines the default route. The
redirect here translates the empty route to the desired default path segment. In this example, the welcome route.
A redirect route requires a path match property to tell the router how to match the URL path segment to the path
of a route. We only want this default route when the entire clan side portion of the path is empty, so we set the
path match to full. The asterisks in the last route denote a wildcard path. The router matches this path if the
requested URL doesn't match any prior paths defined in the configuration. This is useful for displaying a 404 Not
Found Page or redirecting to another route. A few things to note here. There are no leading slashes in our path
segments and the order of the routes in this array matters. The router uses a first match win strategy when
matching the routes. This means that more specific routes should always be before less specific routes, such as
the wildcard route. Ready to try this out? We are back in the sample application with index.html file open. We
want to add a base element just after the head tag. This element tells the router how to compose the navigation
URLs. Since the app folder is the application route, we'll set the hRef for the base tag to slash. Now we are
ready to configure the route definitions. For that, we go to our Angular module, add the appropriate import
statement, then add RoutherModule to the imports array. This registers the router's service provider, declares the
router directives, and exposes the configured routes. How does the RoutherModule know about our configured routes?
We pass them into the RoutherModule by calling forRoot method. We then can figure the routes here by passing them
in using an array. Let's start with the product routes. For each route, we specify the path and a reference to the
component. The template defined in the specified component will display when the router navigates to this path.
Next we add the route to display our Welcome Page. We'll set the path to Welcome and specify the Welcome
Component. When the application loads, we want to default to the template from the Welcome Component so we'll
specify a default route that redirects to our Welcome Component. And let's define a wildcard path in case the
requested URL doesn't match any prior paths defined in the configuration. This is often used for displaying a 404
Not Found page but in our simple example, we'll use it to redirect back to the Welcome Page. There's a lot of
stuff here now in our route application module. In a later course module, we'll look at how to refactor this
module into multiple Angular modules for a separation of concerns.</p>
<h3>Tying Routes to Actions</h3>
<p>With routing, the user can navigate through the application in several ways. The user can click a menu option
link, image, or button that activates, or navigates to, a route. The user can type the associated URL segment in
the address bar after the application URL or use a bookmark to that URL, or the user can click the browser's
forward or back buttons. The route configuration handles the URLs so the last techniques will just work. We need
to handle the first technique by tying routes to the user actions. We need to decide how we will show the routing
options to the user. We could display a navigation pane with links. We can provide a toolbar or images or we can
build a navigation menu like this one. In a more full-featured application, the menu could have many more options
and sub-options but this will do for our purposes. We define that menu as part of this component's template. We
then need to tie a route to each menu option. We do that using the router link directive. The router link is an
attribute directive so we add it to an element such as the anchor tag here and we enclose it in square brackets.
We bind it to a template expression that returns a link parameters array. The first element of this array is the
string path of a route. Additional elements can be added to this array to specify optional route parameters. The
router uses this array to locate the associated route and build up the appropriate URL based on any provided
parameters. when the user selects the option, the associated route is activated. Activating a component route
displays that component's view. Now let's add a menu and use the router link directive so the user can navigate to
the views in our sample application. First, we need to decide how to show the routing options to the user. For our
sample application, we'll build a menu. We want to add that menu at the root of our application so we'll add it to
the app component. In the app component template currently, we're nesting the Product List Component. Let's
replace that with a navigation menu. This menu uses the nav element and the navbar classes from the Twitter
bootstraps styling framework. Let's see how this look in the browser. Here is our new menu, but clicking on the
menu options don't do anything yet and our product list no longer appears. We need to tie routes to these menu
options. Note that we currently have some runtime errors because we have not completed all of the steps needed for
routing. Depending on your selected editor, you many not be able to run the application at this point with these
errors. We'll be finishing up routing soon. We'll use the router link directive to tie a route to each of these
menu options. For the Home menu option, we'll add the router link to the anchor element, but we could use any
clickable element. We want to tie the welcome route to the Home menu option, so we specify Welcome here. Pay close
attention to this syntax. We assign the router link's directive to an array defined within quotes. The first
element of the array is a string, so it is also enclosed in quotes. We'll use similar syntax to tie the product's
route to the Product List menu option. And since we are no longer nesting the Product List Component, we can
remove its selector. Now we just need to tell Angular where to place our views and display the routed components
template. </p>
<h3>Placing the Views</h3>
<p>When a route is activated, the associated component's view is displayed, but displayed where? How do we specify
where we want the routed component to display its view? We use the router outlet directive. We place that
directive in the host component's template. The routed component's view then appears in this location. Let's add
the router outlet to our sample application. We are back looking at the app component because it is the host for
our router. We add the router outlet in the template where we want to display the routed component's view. We'll
put it here. Whenever a route is activated, the associated component's view displays here. Let's see how that
looks in the browser. Oh my, where did that page come from? That's the welcome page provided in the starter files.
When the application launches, the default route is activated and the welcome view displays. If we click on the
Product List menu, the router link directive now activates the Product List route and the list view appears,
sweet. Our application component can now route to multiple views. Notice the URL. The URL segment we defined for
the route is displayed here. If we type in something, like welcome, the welcome component's view is displayed. Now
that we have our routing place, let's review how these routing features work together. When a user navigates to a
feature tied to a route with a router link directive, the router uses the link parameter's array to compose the
URL segment. The browser's location URL is changed to the application URL plus the composed URL segment. The
router searches through the list of valid route definitions and picks the first match. The router locates or
creates an instance of the component associated with that route. The component's view in injected in the location
defined by the router outlet directive and the page is displayed. We now have basic routing in our sample
application, yay! As we've seen in this course module, routing is rather intricate, requiring code in multiple
files and strings such as parameter names and route paths that must match across those files, so let's finish up
this module with some checklists that can help ensure all of the bits of routing are in the right places.</p>
<h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
<p>To route or to nest, that is the question. When creating components we need to think about how they will be
displayed. For components to be nested within other components we need to define a selector as part of the
component decorator. This selector provides the name of the directive and then we nest the component within
another component using directive to define where the component template appears. The component does not then need
a route. For components to be dispalyed as a view within our single application page, the component needs no
selector, but we do need to configure routes. We then tie those routes to actions and action activates a route to
display the view. If we want to do routing in our application, we need to configure the reroute definitions, tie
routes to actions, and place the view. Let's do checklists for each of these tasks. The first step for doing
routing in an application is to configure the routes. Begin by defining the base element in the index.html file.
Add RouterModule to an Angular Module's imports array, then add each route to the array, passed through the
RouterModule's forRoot method. And remember that order matters. The router will pick the first route that matches.
Each route definition requires a path which defines the URL path segment for the route. Be sure the path has no
leading slash. Use an empty path for a default route and two asterisks for a wildcard route, which is matched if
no prior path matches. Most route definitions also include a component. The component is a reference to the
component itself. It is not a string name and is not enclosed in quotes. Once we have the routes configured, we
need to tie those routes to actions. First we identify which actions to tie to which routes. Then we add the
router link directive as an attribute to any clickable element in a component's template. We can use them in menu
options, toolbars, buttons, links, images, and so on. Be sure to enclose the router link in square brackets. Bind
the router link to a link parameters array. The first element of the link parameters array is the route's
path. All other elements in the array are values for the route parameters. Use the router outlet to identify where
to display the routed component's view. This is most often specified in the host component template. When a route
is activated, the route component's view is displayed at the location of the router outlet. This module was all
about navigation and routing. We began with a look at how routing works. We then walked through how to configure
routes, tie routes to actions, and define where the router component's view should appear. Our app component had
embedded our Product List Component as a nested component. In this module, we were finally able to remove that
nesting. We set up routing so we can now navigate to our Welcome and Product List Components. We've covered the
basics of routing in this module, but there is so much more. In the next module, we'll look at some additional
routing techniques and add navigation to the product detail component.</p>
