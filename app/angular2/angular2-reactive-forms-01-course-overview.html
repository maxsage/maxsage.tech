<h3>Course Overview</h3>

<p>Hello, my name is Deborah Kurata. Welcome to my course, Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight. Did you know
    that there are two different ways to create data entry forms in Angular? The template-driven approach uses HTML with
    two-way data binding. The Reactive approach manages the form and its data in the component code. This course looks
    at the similarities and differences between the template-driven and Reactive forms approaches, helping you decide
    the best technique to use for your team and your project. It details how to use the Reactive forms approach,
    shifting the logic for the form from the HTML to the component code, giving you more flexibility and more control.
    It includes techniques such as watching for and reacting to user changes, and dynamically duplicating input
    elements, allowing you to build powerful and Reactive forms. The course walks through validation scenarios, such as
    adjusting validation at run time and custom and cross-field validation. And since forms display and save data,
    you'll learn how to send get, post, put, and delete requests to a web server using HTTP and observables. By the end
    of this course, you'll have the skills to build powerful and dynamic data entry forms using the Reactive forms
    approach. I hope you'll join me on this journey through Angular 2: Reactive Forms, from Pluralsight.</p>
