Data with Http

Getting Data with Http

While building components and services are central to Angular applications, the app wouldn't be very useful
without data and we often get data from remote sources through asynchronous communication. In this module we'll
learn how to connect with the server to get data using http. We'll see how to do this with promises and with
observables using reactive extensions. We'll kick things off by taking a look at how we use http now in Angular
2 and see how it differed from Angular 1. Then we'll explore observables and subscriptions and how we use those
with reactive extensions, and you may remember we covered pipes earlier, there's a special one though called
async, and we're going to take advantage of this one here with the new things that we learn and how to get data
from http. And if you used Angular 1, you definitely took advantage of promises, so we'll take a look at how you
can use promises in Angular 2 as well. Our storyline tracker app needs data and in this module we'll learn how
to use http to do that.

Http

We are definitely going to need to get and send data over http for our storyline tracker app. Well let's learn
how that works with Angular 2. We will need http for our gets, posts, puts, and deletes. Now we could use either
promises or observables with RxJS and we're going to learn about both of these in this chapter. First let's take
a look at where we came from with Angular 1 and how this compares to Angular 2. And you'll be happy to know,
either way, when we want to do a get, it's very similar. We have a service called http in Angular 1 with a
dollar sign in front of it and in Angular 2 it just lacks the dollar sign. So we go ahead and get http.get, we
pass in the URL, and the difference is actually in how it's returned. We can return a promise if we want to with
Angular 2, but by default we get back an RxJS observable. Before we actually execute the http calls, let's learn
how we establish our project with what we need to use http. First we need to pull in the provider. Why? Because
http is just a service like we use any other service in the application and when we use a service we need to
provide it to Angular. So we have to give Angular the http service and it's actually contained within an
HttpModule. So we do that right here. We go get the imported module, http, from the ES6 module that Angular
exposes, and then we import it into our NgModule. Now our application knows about it. Next we define a service.
We can go create a vehicle service and instead of hard coding the list of vehicles or characters like we've done
earlier, now we can actually take advantage of it back end. Here we make our call for http.get against an API
for vehicles, and then we're going to map this observable response so we get out the data that we need because
we get back a response and the response isn't just the data, it's got other stuff in it. In this case the
response has a JSON function which is going to then give us the data in JSON format and we're going to dive into
there and get a data property. And of course we want to handle any errors. I recommend you always, always have
an error handler on all http calls. Alright once we have our service, now we have to listen to it. So we might
have a component, like a vehicle-list.component here, and we inject our vehicleService. Now notice he doesn't
inject http because the service is doing that, it's handling all the http calls for us. Now in the component we
just get back our raw set of vehicles. So we need to subscribe to the observable that is exposed by the service.
The component's handed that observable, right here, and we subscribe to it using the subscribe function. And
then inside of there we pull out the vehicles that we need, and we can also display an error if we want to,
maybe put it on the screen for the user, we could do some logging, pretty much whatever your user experience
team wants you to do with it. Now we just showed the code and how to make all this work, but let's review
because these are important three steps. First we need to make sure that we import the HttpModule and we'll do
that in our app root. That way all of our services in the application can use it. And then we call http.get in a
service and return that mapped result. Finally somebody's going to have to subscribe to that, probably in a
component, we'll subscribe to that result from the service and then do what we want to do with that data. Well
it's time for a demo. Let's go ahead and code up some http in one of our examples.

Using Http in Angular 2

Let's take a look at our demo application and slide on down to Needs Http, number 20. Before you click on that,
this is the one where we're going to add http to the app. If you want to see the completed solution, click on
number 21 and you can just follow along. But I'm going to click on 20. We're going to open this guy up and right
now we've got a list of fighters, basically the X-Wing, B-Wing, and Y-Wing from our vehicles-list.component. And
those are all coming in from a service. So let's move this over to the right and we can see our vehicleService
is being injected and we're getting it back synchronously. We'll go back to the VehicleService now and there it
is. We don't actually want to get them like that though, so we'll comment that out. Let's change some things up.
We'll kill the preview for now. Now first we said we want to use http, so let's import http and the response
from the Angular ES module, for angular/http. Now we've imported that module here, we're going to inject it into
our constructor for the VehicleService. So we have to add a constructor because we didn't have one yet and we'll
create that right there. We'll make it private lowercase http variable of type Http. Once we have that, now we
can call http and we need to have a place to call to. For ease of use in Plunker I've got this vehicles.json
file right here. So we're going to call that. So back in this guy we're going to say return this.http.get and
then we need to pass to it the API call. So mine's going to be API as a folder and then vehicles.json. If you
have a backend like ASP.NET Core or Node Serve, NGINX or Java, you could just point to wherever that backend
happens to be. Now once we get that response we're not quite done because we could return this to our
components, but we should really shape the data up and make sure we got what we need. So we're going to use a
function called map, we're getting back an observable, we're going to map in the response and that's of type
Response, and we're going to use a lambda here, this is just a function that returns something. We want it to
return a list of vehicles, so it's going to be a vehicle array and it's going to be the response.json. So we're
going into the response, we're using its JSON function to get the JSON out, and we're going to go get the data
object out of there and then we're going to cast that into a vehicle array. And then we can end our command. Now
looking inside vehicles we can see there's a data property right there, that's how we said data. So now our
service has what it needs to handle getting the data from a backend and vehicle is right here, we have our model
defined on line 4, 5, and 6. We've got a response and our http that we injected in the constructor and they're
imported up at the top of the page as well. Now before we could use our vehicleService we had to provide it to
our application, so we flip over to our AppModule and we can see it right there on line 17. Perfect. But we're
also using http now, where is that coming from? If we flip back into the vehicle.service we can see we're asking
for it on line 10, but right now the way it's written, Angular is going to say I don't know what that is. In
fact, let's just see what happens over here if we run it and we look at the error messages. Right now it's
telling us, um we've got a problem. The application component is caused by no provider for http. Yes, exactly.
We need to provide it. So I'll go back into the AppModule and let's do that. This looks like a good place, up at
the top of the page let's go get the HttpModule and we're going to get that from, there's a nice convention for
these, it's going to be http just like that. You can see all these things are in @angular/ and then the
submodule. Now what do we do with it once we pull that reference in? We have to import it inside of our imports
list for the NgModule. So we'll stick it right there at the end, I happen to like to alphabetize them, makes it
easier to find. Now once we have http, it's actually going to make that call. We still have a problem because
our component isn't hooked up to talk to our service using the observable yet. So it shouldn't run quite yet,
but let's check out the error, we should get a different error message this time. Alright so now our error
message is this.http.get...map is not a function. That's true. What happened to the map? Well if we flip back
over to our vehicle.service, we used this map function, that is a function that RxJS helps us with. So how do we
use that function? One way to do that is to import it directly from RxJS. So we're going to import everything
inside of RxJS, don't worry, not the whole library. We're going to go specifically into add/operator, and then
we're going to look for map. So we're going to pull out just that one operator. Now let's run it again, make
sure we've got what we need. We're going to get a different error message this time. This time after the map
error message we slide on down and now we're seeing that we have an issue where the NgFor is only supporting
binding to iterables such as arrays. This problem was happening inside of our component. We can see that right
here, the vehicle-list.component. That's because we're returning an observable from here on line 16 back to our
vehicle-list.component and this guy is expecting a synchronous array, well that's not what we're getting. So
let's change this line up. We'll comment out that out so we can see it side by side. We're still going to go out
and call the vehicleService, like that, and it's still called getVehicles. That part didn't change. But now we
need to subscribe to this. And the subscribe is going to return to us different things that we can operate on,
and the first one is going to be, okay if it works, what do you want to do? Here's the function that you insert
and handle. We're going to get a parameter called vehicles and we're going to pass it in and set our local
instance of vehicles to that. Now we could have called this v and that v as well, but I like to make it more
explicit to make it easier to read. So here our subscriber is saying got get the vehicles and set those for me
please. Now the reason that we have this subscribe in here is because we're returning back an observable, and
make sure you don't say vehciles, like I did there. We get that observable back and we're subscribing to the
response and it's taking a function where the parameter is vehicles and we're setting our local this.vehicles
equal to that. Now if we run our application let's see what happens. Here's our demo, and there's our list.
Perfecto.

Adding Exception Handling for Http

Our code is only as good as our error handling, right? So down here we have no error handling so we should add
in a catch statement. So we'll do that and we're going to call local function to handle that error, just to make
it a little bit cleaner, and then we'll make a private local function down here and it's going to accept a
parameter for the error, that's of type Response, which we already have imported on line 2, and then we're going
to console out the error message and we're going to use a message variable, and we're going to go grab that
error message object now. So we're going to say let msg and we're going to use template strings, those are back
ticks, not quotes, and first we're going to say although what's the error message? Status coe is going to be
what? We're going to use this replacement for error.status and we're going to say it's on URL of what? And here
we're going to use error.url. Both those are properties inside of the error object. Great and for right now
we're going to do that and we have to do to handle it even more down here. But there's some clean up we have to
do. For example, right now we're using the catch statement right there, but we're not pulling it in from RxJS,
that's another operator. So we've got to pull that add/operator/catch into our code as well. So now we've got
our catch, we've got handle error, we're just console erroring the message out and let's go ahead and put
something in here like a bunch of X's before vehicle, let's open up our developer tools and we'll run the live
preview. Now let's see what kind of an error message we get. Should be consoling out to our station here. So we
scroll up a little bit, status code 404 on URL and here's the Plunker URL at the end of it with all those X's
vehicles.json. So still not great, but now we know how to get the information out. So the next step is what do
we do with it? Well remember the caller is expecting an observable. One common mistake is to do this and then
after this line 23 we console out, we don't actually do anything after it. But the problem is the component is
going to get back nothing and it's not even observable at this point really. So what we want to do is return
back an Observable.throw, and we're going to send the same message back. Now to do this, we don't yet have the
observable symbol so we're going to pull that out up here, out of RxJS, and that's going to use destructuring to
pull it out of RxJS, and on the Observable we're chaining the throw message, so that one's going to need to go
get the throw. So here we're going to add in not operator, but observable/throw. So we're pulling in just the
pieces of Rx that we want. Now there's a couple of lines of code to do that through lines 4 through 7, really 4,
5, and 7, but the nice thing about this is we're not pulling in all of RxJS, we're just pulling in the pieces
that we want to use, which will make our size of our app a little bit smaller. So now our application is
returning that observable/throw. So what do we do with that? Remember back inside of our component over here,
vehicle-list.component, we had a subscribe. Well the first parameter of subscribe is what happens if it works
and the second parameter is, yeah you guessed it, what happens if it doesn't work? So we're going to get an
error object back, that error parameter right there is the response from this observable.throw, so we can get to
that message. So let's take that and do something with it. Here we happen to have an errorMessage property,
which is up on line 12, which is a string, that we can show on the page. So we'll just say it's of type any and
it's an error because we don't really know what we're getting back in this case. So now if we run the
application and we get an error because we still have a bad URL, we're looking at the error URL on the screen,
which is a little bit easier. Now obviously you don't want to display this exact thing to your user, but this
gives you an idea of how you can flow errors back through your application and then do something with them in
the component level. I recommend logging them at the service level and then at the UI level making the choice of
either do you retry or do you show it to the user or what do you do at that point?

RxJs

We were just dabbling in the world of RxJS with our Angular code, but what exactly were we doing and how does it
work? Well RxJS is not part of Angular, but it's something that's widely used throughout Angular 2. And it's
pretty darn cool actually. You can learn more about it at this reactiveex.io website and there's Rx for many
different languages, this is RxJS, but there's one for .NET, for Swift, for Java, and so on. So you can learn
more about those other languages too. What it really does for us is it implements an asynchronous observable
pattern and yeah we can do the same kind of thing with promises if all we want to do is just go get a value and
then find out what happens when it comes back, but RxJS adds more to it, as we started to get a glimpse of when
we saw the mapping and the catching and throwing. One way to get RxJS was to go get just the individual
operators that we had, another way to do it is to import all of RxJS. Now that's one way of going, but then
you're going to get everything that it's got and when you actually go to bundle and deploy, that's going to be a
lot, a lot, a lot of code, right? Because it's a large library. So for production you only want to import the
modules that you require, like we did in the demo previously. So here's the technique I like to do. I usually
create app.module.ts anyway and inside of there I'll import this file, rxjs-extensions, it's a file I create,
and then I'll go in that file and I'll import all the different RxJS operators that I need to pull in. So this
way I'm preferring to only import the things I'm actually going to use and I get the smallest possible payload
when I bundle and deploy my application. So our catch and our map, those were things we had earlier and we also
had the throw, which came out of RxJS at observable. You can put any of the ones you want in here. Another way
of going is what we did in the demo where we just did each one of the ones that we needed inside of the service
that used them themselves. So really, it's just your preference. But how does RxJS operate? In RxJS you're going
to define an observable and that observable is going to have different people listening to it. In this case
maybe the RxJS observable is going to be something that delivers a message of here's your data, and then the
other guys, over here on the right, are people subscribing or listening to that observable, and it doesn't just
have to be data, it could be some kind of a messaging system where you're saying somebody logged out so you want
to let other people know in your application that that log out occurred so those components can react to it.
Alright so that message just happened, when those pipelines are there, those pipelines allow those guys to
subscribe to the observable and then when a new event occurs the observable gets it and that subscription is
sent to all of the listeners, the subscribers. Now this is an eventing system so each one of those subscribers
needs to basically unsubscribe later. The great thing about the http object, the service that Angular gives us,
is when it gives us back the observable, it'll automatically unsubscribe when it's done. So we don't have to
worry about cleaning up that particular one. If we create a manual observable and subscription, then we're going
to have to clean up our own subscriptions. We'll take a look at that a little later too. So we mentioned http,
let's take a look again and what we did. We used http.get to go off and get our data and we mapped back the
response, that was part of the observable we have. We don't return the response it, we return the JSON that came
out of it. The service does all the work and the consumer simply gets whatever data we wanted. This is our
chance in the map to take that data and basically manipulate it and massage it a little bit and bring it back to
our components. Let's not forget about exception handling. So here we've got our map, we also have a catch,
which calls a local function, it does some work for us to gather the information, and then we'll pass some of
that information back to the component to the consumer for some presentation. So what about that component? Well
that guy is listening, right? He's the one subscribing to the observable and he uses that subscribe function to
do it. And then we use the vehicles and then the error parameters for both the success and the failure functions
to handle those different cases. And these are the basics of using RxJS with Angular 2 and http.

Async Pipe

We learned about pipes in a previous chapter, but we didn't learn too much about the async pipe. And this one
works really well with promises or observables. Let's take a look. The Angular async pipe is a remarkable
example of how you can receive a promise or observable as input and then subscribe to the input automatically.
Eventually it's going to return the values. So as values change and come back through the pipeline, you're going
to see them on the screen. Now the cool part is, if you want to use a pipe and take the existing code we had,
very little has to change. First our service stays exactly the way it was, which is cool because now our service
just emits an observable and in our component, instead of writing the code to handle that observable, we just
get an observable and return it to the screen. Wait, how do we do that? So here instead of having vehicles of
type vehicle array, it's going to be an observable of vehicle array. So we're going to grab the observable and
set it to a local property, and then we're going to bind that property to the screen. So the component is
simplified, there's less code here. So what changes in the template? Very simply we add the pipe up there and we
say async, and that will subscribe to the vehicles and return the stream right to the template. The async pipe
is a self cleaning pipe, async will automatically unsubscribe to the observable when the template goes away.
Well let's take a look at our existing example and add an async pipe to it and show the differences.

Adding an Async Pipe with an Observable

It's time for us to go play with some pipes, so we go down in our demo here, we can see that we've got 21 that's
Http and then 22 is the completed example with the pipe already in it. So if you want to look at the complete
one, go to 22, but we're going to add together on line 21 here, the http example, we're going to add the async
pipe to it. So I'll go into this guy, he's already getting back a list, we're good to go, and he's got a
service, which is returning back our observable. Perfect. Let's go inside the vehicle list because that's what
we're going to change this pipe. We'll just pull the preview over for now, and first we know that if we're
getting back an async pipe we don't need to process and subscribe like this inside of here, so I'll comment that
out just to show what it looks like, and instead of calling that and then doing a subscribe, instead we'll set
that equal to vehicles, like that. Now we've got vehicles, but right now the vehicles is an array of vehicles,
we don't want that. We want an observable of vehicle array. And because we're referencing observable now, we
have to come back up to the top and import that from Rx, so we'll pull that observable from rxjs/Observable. Now
we've got an observable coming out of our service and we remove those four lines of code, so let's go into the
template itself and up top here we can see we're getting a vehicles list and we're going to say async like that,
after the pipe character. And now you can see we've got an Imperial Star Destroyer. You might be wondering
though, what about error messages, if something happens? Well we can still go back inside our
vehicle-list.component and we can put a catch on here, and then handle the error. So we can chain the catch off
of this with no problem. And we can see with the async pipe it makes it a little bit easier to flow the data
from the service through the component up to the template.

Promises with Http and the Async Pipe

Well it's time to take a look at how we use promises instead of observables, because that's just another option
we have. So let's flip back to our demos, and inside of our demos we can see we've got the Http example in 21
and the Http with Async Pipe on 22, well 23 is completed with Http and Promises and let's click on that one and
see how the differences are. Now our service over here, for the same kind of application, looks slightly
different, and in that sense what it's doing is we're saying return http.get, we're still mapping it, but
there's one extra line, line 16, toPromise. So we're going toPromise instead of returning an observable. Now
because we're using toPromise here, we have to make sure that our Rx extensions is actually pulling in
toPromise, right there on line 6 of the Rx extensions file. So we've got that. He's returning a promise, let's
check out what the component does with that promise. Now we have two options here, just like with observables,
we could take the observable and stream it up to the template using the async pipe, which is what we're doing
here, or we could do a .then. So let's use the async pipe here. We've got the this vehicles equal to our promise
now. So line 19 sets the vehicles to a promise, it means line 14 has to change to be a promise of vehicle array
and then we have to make sure that we're good to go with this vehicles list by looking inside the component, and
notice it's exactly the same code up here. The async pipe on line 2 can handle a promise or an observable. Now
if we wanted to use a promise and not the async pipe, we would remove that async here, go back to our component,
don't make it be a promise, just make it be a vehicle array, like that, but now we couldn't do this line of
code, instead what we'd have to do is type in, although go get our vehicles, and then with a then, we have a
function here where we pass in our response for vehicles and then we could set the vehicles inside of this call
back. Then we could also do a catch statement here too. Just kind of similar like to what we did with the
observable here. But the async pipe makes it a little bit simpler to do. So what does all this mean? It means
that we have options and options are pretty good. We can use observables or promises and we can use it in code
or we can use the async pipe.

Http in the Storyline Tracker

Well let's take a look now how we put all these things together inside of the storyline tracker using the async
pipe and the observables. Flipping over to our example demos, if you haven't done so already, once you open the
storyline tracker, you can click on this little cloud with the arrow on it to download the file or directory and
then it pulls down a zip file. And then you can take that file and you can open it up inside of a folder. If
you'd like to follow along inside of the Plunker, that's fine too. But I'm going to open it up inside of Visual
Studio Code. So first let's take a look at the vehicleService, if you can't find that go ahead and hit Command+P
and you can type in vehicle and then you can type in part of the word, like type veh.ser, like this, it'll
actually pattern match it, you can find the vehicleService. Scrolling down we can see we've got a getVehicles
and we've got a getVehicle and then we've got an updateVehicle, we've got delete as well and we've got an add.
All of these actions are in here for handling our http requests, and you can see right here on line 42 we're
actually going off and calling http and we're getting the vehicles by URL, we're mapping the response, we're
handling an error, and then we're hiding a spinner with a finally at the end. The map, the catch, and the
finally are all different functions we can operate on the observable. So notice we're returning an observable of
vehicle array on line 42. The point of this is we're going to do something with that observable and that's going
to be handled in the component. So let's go look at the vehicle-list.component. We can either navigate there
over on the left to the vehicle-list or, again, we can hit Command+P up top and then we can type in vehicle and
maybe type in list, like that. Now we find the vehicle-list and we can see on line 30 we've got a getVehicles
function. He's calling the vehicleService getVehicles and then he's subscribing to it, taking that response, and
then manipulating it and then showing it on the screen so that this.vehicles on line 34, that's getting set, is
a property of this class and that property is set right up here on line 18, and that's bound in the template.
Well there's another way that we can handle these, right? This is not using the async pipe, but we do have a
place that does that. Let's go check out our characterService and that service, if we go up and look for him,
it's going to be character.ser, he also has an add and a delete and a getCharacters. Same kind of code we had
with the vehicles, and how's that going to be handed in the character-list.component? Let's go find out. If we
type in car list and then we go look at that guy, he also has a characters array here and he's going to pull
them out by subscribing to them, but characters are used by more than one screen. There's the character screen
and there's also the dashboard. So let's go find the dashboard component and the dashboard component, notice on
line 18 we have a characters property and that's an observable of character array, so down in getCharacters,
we're just setting this characters to the getCharacters function, and then we're using a do on there that's a
side effect that we can use to say okay, show up the toaster and then we can handle any errors here, but what's
nice about this is it looks a little more straightforward, looks as little less asynchronous in a way, so we're
just saying take this property and set it to the response of this, which is going to be an observable of
character array, and then our template for dashboard HTML, we can go see the async right there on line 6, so we
say let character of characters pipe async. And that's going to pull the observable in and every time we get the
data back from that service to the component, it's going to stream it up to the view. So here are a couple
different examples of how we're using observables with and without the async pipe in the storyline tracker.

Putting It All Together

We learned quite a bit this chapter on how to get our data for the storyline tracker app. We pulled in
characters and vehicles using http. Let's look back at how we used http because we got that library, we pulled
it in, and we imported it, we told ourselves about the http providers, but then we had to use observables and
subscribe to them. When we use http.get we get back an observable and then we subscribe to that inside of our
component. But we also have the option of just linking an async pipe directly to it. So we tried that too and
that make our code a little bit cleaner. And for when we want to use a promise, we can also use that from
http.gets as well by just doing the toPromise method. And by using what we learned about http in this chapter,
we no longer have to rely on getting hard coded values for vehicles and characters, we can go call API for that
and we also have additional power because we're not just getting data, we're putting and posting and deleting
our characters and vehicles, which lets us build a more robust app.
