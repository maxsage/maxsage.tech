    <h2>Retrieving Data Using HTTP</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The data for our application is on a server somewhere in cloud, at the office, under our desk. How do we get that
      data into our view? Welcome back to Angular 2 getting started from Pluralsight. My name is Deborah Kurata, and in
      this module we learn how to use Http with observables to retrieve data. Most Angular applications obtain data
      using Http. The application issues an Http get request to a web service. That web service retrieves the data,
      often using a database, and returns it to the application in an Http response. The application then processes that
      data. In this module, we begin with an introduction to observables and the reactive extensions. We then examine
      how to send an Http request and map the result to an array. We add some exception handling, and we look at how to
      subscribe to observables to get the data for our view. We finished the first cut of a product data service in the
      last module, but it still has hard-coded data. Now we'll replace that hard-coded data with Http calls. Let's get
      started.</p>
    <h3>Observables and Reactive Extensions</h3>
    <p>Observables help us manage asynchronous data, such as data coming from a backend service. Observables treat
      events as a collection. We can think of an observable as an array whose items arrive asynchronously over time. On
      the timeline to the left, the first marble comes in, then the second, and some time later the third. Observables
      are a proposed feature for ES 2016, the next version of JavaScript. To use observables now, Angular uses a
      third-party library called reactive extensions. Don't confuse this with React, which is another thing entirely.
      Observables are used within Angular itself, including Angular's event system and its Http client service, which is
      why we are covering them here. Observables allow us to manipulate sets of events with operators. Operators are
      methods on observables that compose new observables. Each operator transforms the source observable in some way.
      Operators do not wait for all of the values and process them at once. Rather, operators on observables process
      each value as it is emitted. Some examples of operators include map, filter, take, and merge. Data sequences can
      take many forms, such as a response from a backend web service, a set of system notifications, or a stream of
      events, such as user input. In this diagram, our stream contains three elements. Reactive extensions represent a
      data sequence as an observable sequence, commonly just called an observable. A method in our code can subscribe to
      an observable to receive asynchronous notifications as new data arrives. The method can then react as data is
      pushed to it. The method is notified when there is no more data or when an error occurs. Observables support
      operators, such as the map operator. The map operator allows us to transform the incoming data. The argument to
      the map operator is an arrow function that says to take each data item and transform it to 10 times its value. So
      when we receive one, it is mapped to 10. When we receive two, it is mapped to 20, and so on. This depiction is
      called a marble diagram and is helpful for visualizing observable sequences. This is a screenshot from Rxmarbles
      at this URL. You may have worked with asynchronous data in JavaScript previously using promises. Observables are
      different from promises in several ways. A promise returns a single future value. An observables emits multiple
      asynchronous values over time. A promise is not lazy. By the time you have a promise, it's on its way to being
      resolved. An observable is lazy by default. Observables will not emit values until they are subscribed to. A
      promise is not cancellable. It is resolved or rejected and only once. An observable can be cancelled by
      unsubscribing. Plus an observable supports map, filter, reduce, and similar operators. Note, however, that you can
      use promises instead of observables when calling Http in Angular if you wish. An example is provided in the
      Angular documentation. In this module, we'll do Http using observables. </p>
    <h3>Sending an HTTP Request</h3>
    <p>We often encapsulate the data access for our application into a data service that can be used by any component or
      other service that needs it. In the last module, we did just that, but our product data service still contains a
      hard-coded list of products. We instead want to send an Http request to get the products from a backend web
      server. Angular provides an Http service that allows us to communicate with a backend web server. Using the
      familiar Http request and response protocol. For example, we call a get method of the Http service, which in turn
      sends a get request to the web server. The web server response is returned from the Http service to our product
      data service as an observable. What does this look like in code? This is the product service we built in the last
      module modified to retrieve the products using Angular's Http service. Let's walk through this code. First we
      specify a URL to the products on the web server. This defines where we send our Http requests. Note that this URL
      is shown for illustration purposes only and is not a real URL. Next we add a constructor. Recall from the last
      course module that we use a constructor to inject dependencies. In this case, we need Angular's Http service, so
      we inject it here. Recognize this syntax? It creates a private_http variable and assigns the injected service
      instance to that variable. And since we are strongly typing this variable to Http, we import Http from the
      @angular/http package here. As a side note, we had mentioned earlier that in some cases the injectable decorator
      was optional. Now that our product service has an injected dependency, the injectable decorator is required.
      Recall also from the last course module that before we can inject a service in as a dependency, we need to
      register that service's provider with Angular's injector. The Http service provider registration is done for us in
      the Http module included in the @angular/http package. To include the features of this external package in our
      application, we add it to the imports array of our application's Angular module, AppModule. Recall that the
      declarations array is for declaring components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module. The imports
      array is for pulling in external modules, so we use the imports array to pull in this external HttpModule. Now our
      Angular module illustration looks like this. We declare our components. We declare the directives and pipes that
      those components require, and we import the external modules that we need. And for Http, we need HttpModule. Going
      back to the product service, in getProducts we use the injected Http service instance and call the get method,
      passing in the desired URL. The Http service then sends a get request using the specified URL. But what does this
      method now return? Since we are using strong typing, we should have a function return value here. The getProducts
      method returns an observable of Response. Does this generic syntax look familiar? We used it earlier in this
      course to define the event payload when passing event information from a nested component to its container.
      Observables take advantage of generics to define the type of data it is observing in the observable sequence. In
      this case, it's the Http Response. It's important to note that Http calls are single asynch operations, meaning
      that the observable sequence contains only one element, which is the Http Response object. And we need to import
      Response from the @angular/http package and observable from rxjs/Observable. But let's think about this return
      value for a moment. Do we really want an observable of Response? Our components, such as the product list
      component, are expecting to receive a list of products, not an Http response. So we need to translate the Response
      object to an array of products. We do that with the map operator. The map operator takes the raw Http Response
      object returned from the Http get method and translates it into an array of products. The argument to the map
      method is an arrow function that transforms the response to a JSON object. We use a casting operator to cast the
      JSON object to an array of products. So now our getProducts returns an observable of IProduct array, which is much
      more useful for our components. Note that depending on your server, the JSON result may be wrapped in another
      property, such as a data property. If that is the case, use response.json.data here. To use the map operator, we
      need to load it using an import statement. Using the import statement like this is a bit unusual. It tells the
      module loader to load this library but actually doesn't import anything. When a library loaded, its JavaScript is
      executed, and for this particular library, executing the JavaScript loads the map operator. So this particular
      syntax imports the module for its side-effects only, without actually importing any of its features. Now let's add
      Http to our product service. We are looking at our applications Angular module we called AppModule. Recall from
      the slides that Angular registers its Http service provider in an Angular module called HttpModule. In our
      application's Angular module, we import the HttpModule. This module is located in the @angular/http package. We
      then pull that module into our application by adding HttpModule to the imports array here. Now we can inject the
      Angular Http service into any class that needs it. Here is the product data service we created in the last module
      with all of the hard-coded data. We want to modify our product service to get the product data using Http. Let's
      start at the top with the import statements. We import the Http client service and the Http Response from
      @angular/http. We important observable from rxjs/Observable. And we import the map operator using the special
      syntax that loads the operator without actually importing anything. We want Angular to provide us an instance of
      the Http client service, So we identify it as a dependency in the constructor. We don't have a constructor yet, so
      let's add that first. Then we specify the parameter. Angular will then inject the Http client service instance
      into this variable. Now we need to identify the location of our web server. Hmm, this doesn't look like a valid
      URL to a web server. To keep things simple, the demonstration reads the data from a local JSON file that was
      provided with the starter files. That way we don't need to set up an actual web server. To change this code to
      work against a web server, simply change this URL to point to an appropriate web server. And, of course, you need
      to write the server-side code to return the list of products. It's finally time to delete our hard-coded data. So
      let's delete the hard-coded products from the getProducts method. Gone. We'll call the http.get method here
      instead, passing in the defined URL. When we get a response back, we use the map operator to map the Http response
      to a product array using response.json. We'll need to change the return type as well. Now this method returns an
      observable of IProduct array. We can't try this out at this point, because we are not yet subscribing to the
      observable returned from the service. Let's add some exception handling first, then modify the product list
      component to subscribe to the observable list of products. </p>
    <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
    <p>As you can imagine, there are many things that can go wrong when communicating with a backend service. Everything
      from an invalid request to a lost connection. So let's add some exception handling. We'll add a catch and pass it
      the name of an error-handling method. The error-handling method gets one parameter, the error: Response object. In
      that method, we can handle the error as appropriate. We can send the error information to the remote logging
      infrastructure or throw an error to the calling code. And notice here one more thing, the observable has a do
      operator that allows us to peek at the data returned from the server without disrupting the flow. We can use this
      operator when debugging to log data to the console, for example. Notice we also need two more import statements,
      one for each additional operator we are using. Now let's add exception handling to our product service. This code
      is not really complete without the exception handling. So we'll add the appropriate imports and use the catch
      operator to call a local handleError method. In this method, we can log or handle errors any way we want. For our
      sample application, we simply log to the console and throw an error to the calling code. Let's also try out the do
      operator. The do operator lets us peek at the response data. We use JSON.stringify to display that data in a nicer
      format. So our getProducts method is complete. We can add other methods here to post or put data as well. We can't
      see the result of our hard work yet because we are not subscribing to this observable. Let's do that next.</p>
    <h3>Subscribing to an Observable</h3>
    <p>If you are familiar with promises, you know that you receive the result of the promise, X in this illustration,
      by calling then. Then takes two arguments, a value function that is called when the promise completes successfully
      and an error function to handle any error condition. If we define X as an observable instead, we simply replace
      the then with subscribe. Since observables handle multiple values over time, the value function is called for each
      value the observable emits. In some cases, we want to know when the observable completes, so observables provide
      an optional third handler that is executed on completion. The subscribe function returns a subscription. We could
      use that subscription to call unsubscribe and cancel the subscription if needed. Now that our product data service
      is returning an observable, any class that needs product data, such as our product list component, can call our
      service and subscribe to the returned observable like this. As we stated earlier, observables are lazy. An
      observable doesn't start emitting values until subscribe is called, so this line of code calls the product data
      service getProducts method and kicks off the Http get request. It is then set up to asynchronously receive data
      and notifications from the observable. The first function passed to the subscribe method specifies the action to
      take whenever the observable emits an item. The method parameter is that emitted item. Since Http calls are single
      asynch operations, only one item is emitted, which is the Http response object that was mapped to our product
      array in the service. So the parameter is our array of products. This code then sets the local products property
      to the returned array of products. The second function is executed if the observable fails. In this example, it
      sets a local error message variable to the returned error. A third function not used here specifies the action to
      take when the observable ends with a completed notification. The third function is rarely used when working with
      Http requests since they automatically complete after emitting the single response. And we aren't using the return
      value here since we have not provided an option for the user to cancel the request. Let's give this a try. Here in
      the product list component, we see a syntax error. Type observable of IProduct array is not assignable to IProduct
      array. Now that we've changed the product service to return an observable, we cannot assign the result to our
      product property directly. Rather, we subscribe to the returned observable. When the observable emits the data, we
      set our product property to the returned array of products. And since that product property is bound in the
      components template, the retrieved data just appears in the view. But things don't always go as expected. To
      handle any errors, let's add an error message property. If our request for products fails, our error message
      property is set to the error. What is this any syntax? This is a casting operator. We are casting the error
      returned from the observable to the any data type. Are we ready to try it out? There are our products. Success. We
      have more products here now because we are retrieving the products form the provided product.json file.
      Sweet. Remember the do we added to the Http get pipeline? It displays the retrieved data. If we open the F12
      developer tools, we see that data in the console here. So the recommended way to use Http is to encapsulate it in
      a service like our product service, then expose an observable for use by any class that needs product data. The
      class simply subscribes to the observable and waits for data or a notification. Let's finish up this module with
      some checklists we can use as we work with Http and observables. </p>
    <h3>Checklists and Summary</h3>
    <p>Before we can use Angular's Http client service, some setup is required.>We need to ensure that the service
      prodiver is registered with the Angular injector. This registration is done for us in the Http module included in
      the Angular Http package. So all we need to do is pull the Http module into our application. We do this by adding
      Http module to the imports array of one of our application's Angular modules. Build a data access service to wrap
      Http requests. In that data service, specify the needed imports, define a dependency for the Angular Http client
      service using a constructor parameter. Create a method for each Http request. In the method, call the desired Http
      method, such as get, and pass in the URL to the desired server. Use a map operator to transform the raw Http
      response to a JSON object. And do error handling as desired. In any class that needs data from a data service,
      call the subscribe method to subscribe to the observable. Provide a function to execute when the observable emits
      an item. This often assigns a property to the returned JSON object, and if that property is bound to a template,
      the retrieved data appears in the view. And add an error function to handle any returned errors. This module was
      all about Http and observables. We began with an overview of observables and reactive extensions. We examined how
      to build a data access service that sends requests for data over Http. We walked through how to set up some
      basic exception handling, and we saw how to subscribe to the returned observable and ultimately display the
      resulting data in the view. We've now removed the hard-coded data from the product data service. Yay. And instead
      retrieved the data using Http.>In our sample application, we are using Http to retrieve the data from a local JSON
      file. But the techniques are the same for retrieving data from a backend service.>Next up, we'll see how to
      display multiple pages with navigation and routing.</p>
