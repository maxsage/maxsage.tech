<h3>Course Overview</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Deborah Kurata and I'd like to welcome you to my course, Angular 2: Getting Started, from
  Pluralsight. This beginner-level course takes you on a journey through the basic features of Angular 2. It guides
  you down the right path, making your own journey with Angular 2 more pleasant and productive. Along the way, we
  build a sample application so you can code along or use it as a reference for your own development. You'll see how
  Angular provides a consistent set of patterns for building components, templates, and services, helping you come
  up to speed quickly. This course covers how to build components, how to create the user interface for your
  application in a template, and power it up with data binding and directives. You'll discover how to build services
  for logic needed across components, and inject those services where they are needed. You'll learn how to send
  requests to a web server using HTTP and observables. And you'll see how to set up routing to navigate between the
  views of your application. By the end of this course, you will know the basics you need to get started building an
  Angular 2 application. I hope you'll join me on this journey through Angular 2: Getting Started from
  Pluralsight. </p>
