<h2>Angular Modules</h2>

<h3>Types of Feature Modules</h3>

<p>As an application grows it becomes really important to be able to break your application up into different
sections or pieces of functionality. And when that time comes, we create Angular modules. In this chapter we're
going to learn more about Angular modules. We've already had one, our app module, but we also can have routed
modules. For example we can eager or we can lazy load our modules. This gives us an advantage so we can decide
how we want to load the different content of our application. And we also have options on how we can do our
preloading strategies with lazy loading, and beyond routed modules, there's other types of feature modules and
we'll learn about those because they become important as we design larger applications. And we'll revisit how
providers work inside of modules so they can understand the decisions that we make and how that impacts the
design of our application. Angular modules help us divide our app up into cohesive blocks of functionality. It's
a great way to organize our application. Before we dive into the details of these modules, let's take a high
level overview of the different kinds of modules that we can have. We have domain feature modules, this might be
an ngModule that was directly imported by the app route module. No routing involved whatsoever. And then there's
routed modules, these are ngModules that we would route to. In our storyline tracker application we might use
this for the characters or the vehicles. Those could become modules that we route to. A third type of feature
module could be a service feature module. We may have a message service or a logger service or even an exception
service in our application. These services are core to the entire application and we might want to make them
available everywhere, but only make them singletons. This is a common technique in building an application and
we might just directly import this into our app route and make it available throughout the app by providing
those services in the app routes providers. And a fourth type of feature module could be a widget feature
module. Our application might have a calendar control or a filtering text box control or any kind of a custom
control, and those different widgets could be aggregated and placed into a single module or a widget module.
That widget module might be shared throughout the application, but unlike the service module we actually want
multiple instances of each widget. For example, if I have two data calendars on the same page I don't want them
to share the same instance, they should have their own state and their own behavior. Throughout this chapter
we'll talk about all four types of these feature modules, but first let's start with the routed module, because
we can eagerly or lazily load them.</p>

<h3>Eager Loading</h3>

<p>When we define a module that we're going to route to, the easiest way to get there is to eagerly load them. We
get all those modules right up front. Eager loading is when we load a feature module right at startup. We're
getting it eagerly, right with the route module. Ideal candidates in our application would be the characters or
the vehicles areas, those could become feature modules that we eagerly load. When we eagerly load modules, we're
getting them right away. This means they're ideal for things that we need to have for the application at
startup, things that the user expects to be there to make the application functional. If we have several
components that make up our dashboard and that's the first thing our users see when they launch the app, we
could make that a dashboard module and eagerly load it. So when designing our application, we keep in mind the
things that we want the user to use right away. Let's take a look at how we define different modules. If you
wanted to take our characters feature area and turn it into a feature module, we could define
character-routing.module, like this. We separate our routes out and we create an ngModule for it. Very similar
to what we did earlier with the root module. So our routes are good to go, but one big difference is we make
sure we use the forChild feature for any feature module routes. Remember the app route module used the forRoot,
that's because it was the root. For any features modules we use forChild. Once we create that router module, we
then import that into a feature module called characters module. So just like we did this pattern with the route
where we had app routing module and we imported it into the app module, we're taking the character routing
module and we're pulling it into the characters module, and we do that right over here. The characters module
declares all the components that might be used inside that characters feature module. It also provides any
services for that module. It's a way of encapsulating all the different functionality that characters are going
to need, whether it's characterList or characterDetails or characterEditing, all that information is contained
inside this one module, including its routing module. Now that we have the characters module, that gets imported
into our roott module directly. So we go back to the AppModule, which we always have, and we import the
CharactersModule and we get its routes automatically. The nice thing about this is when we have different
feature modules all we have to do to pull them in is go to our root module and just import that feature module.
One point in case, order does matter here. If you have routes in different modules, they actually get traversed
in the order they're added. This becomes important if you have a star route. A star route is often looked at as
a 404 route or a page not found route. You probably want that one to come in last. Now let's go take a look at
one of our demos and see how eagerly loading modules works for us.</p>

<h3>Eagerly Loading Routed Modules</h3>

<p>Let's flip back over to our demo application and go down to number 27, Eagerly Loaded Routes. In here we're
going to see a routed module, a feature module, for the characters and for the vehicles. Notice the application
still has routing, characters, and vehicles here. And we still have our AppRoutingModule, but in this
AppRoutingModule I only have my routes for the default route, which is going to redirect to /characters, and
notice that's not defined here, and I also have a star route, for the page not found. So where are the other
routes? Well let's go inside vehicles and here we can see the entire vehicles folder is contained with this
vehicles feature module and this vehicles feature module has the declarations for all the routed components,
what are they? We'll go look at those in a moment, and then a VehiclesRoutingModule. Both of those are inside of
my VehiclesRoutingModule, so I have my ngModule here and I have its routing module there and I define the
vehicles and the paths for the different vehicle list and vehicle component, and notice on line 20 I'm using
forChild for the routes. And those routed components that's just that convenience that we used earlier for the
other routing modules we did where we take these different components, we put them in an array and we export
them, that way we don't have to repeat these three import statements back in our vehicles module. This makes the
ngModule file really short and small. So now our routing is really self contained and what makes it eager is
because we go back into our AppModule and the AppModule is actually referring directly to that routed feature
module for vehicles and one for characters. We can see those here being imported with their ES6 modules on lines
9 and 10, and then we're putting them in the imports of the ngModule down here on line 20 and line 16. So now
our AppModule pulls in the VehiclesModule and the CharactersModule along with its routes and all of its
components and all the functionality. And because there's a direct reference to it using symbols, all of it is
eagerly loaded, and notice we have AppRoutingModule listed last, that's important because remember that is where
we had our star route and that one needs to come last because that matched first, everything comes after it
would be ignored because that would satisfy pretty much anything we pass in to a route. So now we run our
application, everything is eagerly loaded and we get all the data up front. Everything's just there and ready to
go. But sometimes we don't want it all to be loaded up front, and we'll talk about that next with lazily loaded
feature modules.</p>

<h3>Lazy Loading</h3>

<p>We want to make our applications really snappy for our users, so we'll provide all the data they need up front
to be eagerly loaded and then content they might need later to be lazy loaded. Lazy loading of modules is on
demand, we get it just in time, right when we need it. This is going to lower the initial payload and make our
application feel much faster for the user. Let's picture this scenario, we're got an application where all the
components that the user wants to use right away, like our dashboard and our menus, they could be loaded
eagerly, there's the ones over here on the left. And which ones those are need to be identified by you and your
design team to figure out how the user's behavior is. And then we could have a router where when they click on a
particular link, we go and we lazy load another module and that contains more functionality for the user. When
the user clicks on that link and the lazy loading starts, what's happening is a fetch is performed to go get
that content. So we can route to modules eagerly, which means they get the content at startup and they can use
those features right away. Or we can use lazy loading for some of the modules. That means some of it'll come on
demand. This is more ideal for anything that's not in the immediate workflow for the user. Let's take a look at
how lazy loading would be implemented. For lazily loading modules, we want it to find those in something that's
eagerly loaded. Let's pause on that for a minute because this is important. Our app route module is already
there, it's eagerly loaded. We need the app route. From there, things could be eagerly or lazily loaded. If
we're going to lazy load from there, that content isn't there yet. So if we want to go get that content, it
makes sense that the app route module would know here to go get those lazily loaded modules. That's why we
define those paths right here. Notice we have characters and vehicles here and we're using the loadChildren
property and then we define a string path and where to find those modules. It's got to be a string and not a
symbol because if you use a symbol here and define the component, like we did with the page not found, it's
going to eagerly load them. Because it's a string and we're using a loadChildren it knows, okay this is going to
be lazy loaded, and we use the hash to define that's the name of the module you want to get from that file. So
the characters and vehicles are going to lazily load and they're not going to be directly imported. Now let's go
back to our demos and we'll take a look at the lazily loading modules to see how that works in our application.</p>

<h3>Lazily Loading Routed Modules</h3>

<p>We flip back to our demo app, we'll slide on down to demo 28, Lazily Load Routes. Here we'll click on the sample
and we're going to see the same kind of application, but now we're going to use lazy loading. First we see we
get our characters right away, now let's click on vehicles. I'll tell you when I'm going to click, 1-2-3-click,
and notice that we have a slight delay right there. Now we go back to characters, it's instant, go back to
vehicles, it's instant. Can you guess what's happening? Yeah, the lazy loading is happening for the vehicles.
Let's go check the network tools. If we come over here and we'll hide the file list because we want to see the
entire network bandwidth. Now let's reload this by looking at the characters first and now clearing out the
network content, we'll get rid of the console as well by hitting the Escape key in the bottom, and now all of
our network traffic is gone. Now it's refreshed by clicking the refresh live preview and we'll see the content
come across. Notice all the files are getting loaded. Now let's clear that content and let's click on the
vehicles. Notice we're getting vehicle content at this point because we lazy loaded it. Awesome. Well we want to
explore both sides of the pros and cons here, let's open the File Explorer up and go look at our code. If we
look in the app.-routing.module, we notice we have vehicles here lazy loading, but characters is not. So we'll
go back to the app.module itself because remember he's the guy who controls everything, he's the first one that
gets loaded up. Notice we have a CharactersModule eagerly loaded on line 17. That one's coming up front and that
makes sense in this app because that's the first thing we see when the application loads. But notice there's no
sign of vehicles in this app.module. In fact, the only sign of it is in the app-routing.module because we have
the lazy loading reference here on line 8. And then inside the vehicles.module, it is just a normal module. It's
got its own declarations and providers and looks just like any eagerly loaded module would look too, and it's
got its own routes as well. The one difference here is that the route has a default path. Not that default path
isn't the same as the default path of the app-routing.module, because I'm in the vehicles-routing.module, this
default path actually takes on everything that the root module had and then puts this on it as well. So let's
take a look at that. Back in the app-routing.module, if I was at path blank, that would go to characters. If I'm
at path vehicles, that would lazy load this module. So now I'm at path/vehicles and I go into the
vehicles-routing.module. So /vehicles is my starting point and then tack on the empty string, and I'm still at
/vehicles. Then my child routes are /vehicles and /vehicles id. So now that we know how to do this, let's take a
look at the pros and cons again for a moment. When the application loads, it loads relatively quick because
characters is all we're really getting up front. Characters and then the app.module itself. So we don't have to
wait for the vehicles content to come across the wire. That's the pro of lazy loading. Now imagine we had 10
different menu items. We don't have to wait for the other nine if we just load the dashboard of the characters
first. The downside is the first time that the user clicks on one of these lazy load module links, it might take
a moment to go get that content. What if we could have the best of both worlds? Wouldn't that be great? Let's
talk about that next.</p>

<h3>Defining Preload Strategies</h3>

<p>We want the user to have an awesome experience by getting the content quickly so we eagerly load. But we really
don't want them to have to wait for that lazily loaded content when they click on it. What if we could take that
lazily loaded content and preload it with a different kind of strategy? That's where preload strategies come
into play. A preload strategy is designed to help the problem where a user clicks on a link that goes and gets a
lazily loaded module and there's a slight delay. With a preload strategy, the router can go get that lazy loaded
content in the background and this can improve the user experience. The user gets all their eagerly loaded
content right away, and while they're interacting with that, in the background Angular is going off and
preloading the lazy loaded content. Let's see how we can do this. Out of the box we get some preload strategies.
We have PreloadAllModules or NoPreloading. We import these from the Angular Router ES module. And then we pass
that strategy to the forRoot function. So we could say preload strategy is PreloadAllModules and if we do this
by default, anything that's lazily loaded will start to preload in the background, but it won't delay the user's
experience of using and interacting with the eagerly loaded modules. Pretty cool huh? Now what if you wanted to
just preload some things but not others? Well we can do that too with a custom preload strategy. For this we
have to implement an interface. We create a preload-strategy class and we can name it whatever we want, and we
implement the PreloadingStrategy interface, which has a preload function. Once we do that, we can write any
logic we want that just determines how do we load things, and if we want the content to preload based upon our
logic, we just call the load function. Now how do we use this class? We go back to our app-routing.module and in
here we specify a data property and we use the preload right there, which matches the preload function in the
preload-strategy. And we can say okay for this speakers route, it's lazy loaded, I know this because I see the
loadChildren and it's pointing to a string path, and I know it's going to use this strategy because I'm setting
the preload to true and then I have to tell the application that I want to use this strategy. So in the
AppRoutingModule we passed to the forRoot this preloadingStrategy of PreloadSelectedModulesList, which is the
one we defined up top. Now let's go back to the storyline tracker application, which has a lot of lazy loaded
content, and we'll see how preloading can really help the user experience.</p>

<h3>Preload Strategies in the Storyline Tracker</h3>

<p>When we launch the storyline tracker application we can see that we've got dashboard, characters, vehicles,
admin and login. These are all different modules, feature modules, and they all happen to also be routed
featured modules. Let's go take a look at how we've defined them. In the app-routing.module, we can see there's
an admin, dashboard, characters, and vehicles, all are using loadChildren, all are lazily loaded. Now we also
had a login, that's got its own module and that module is not lazy loaded. How do I know that? If I go back into
the app-module itself, notice I have a direct reference to the login module. This kind of makes sense from a
design. If we look at our application, I don't want to lazy load any of those four, but the login is something
we definitely want to be available for users. And when I click on those menu items, notice even though they're
lazy loaded, I'm getting them immediately, there's no delay. That's because we're preloading these modules. If
we go back inside of our app-routing.module, we can see here at the top, if we close out of the app, we have
PreloadAllModules on line 2. And then we're using that same strategy down in line 32 by passing it to the
forRoot. Well let's run this application and let's close the code and go into the dev tools and we'll watch the
network traffic. And you can see these bars going across the top as it loads the content. The application is
still loading, it's taking a while because we're loading file by file at this point and not doing any bundling
or deployment strategies, but right through here you can see different gaps. And if I look at those gaps, you'll
be able to tell different content that's occurred. So let's start over here. This content is going to show us
basically all the stuff that Angular needs to run by default in RxJS. Now if we scroll back over here, we're
still getting some of that. And then we can see that we're getting our navigation and our login, all that stuff
that comes up front, that's part of the app-route.module and the login.module, the eagerly loaded stuff. Now
we're getting the dashboard, but wait the dashboard was lazy loaded, right? Our application was actually usable
right about this point, right after it got all this nav content in our app and then we started getting our lazy
loaded content. Now if we see that again, and we'll refresh from scratch, right around this time period, we
should be able to use the application. So we should see it on the left hand side like this, we'll clear out the
content and let's refresh the app. So the application is loading and we can see that it's getting the content,
and you'll notice after it becomes usable, on the left hand side they'll still be content coming across the
wire. See the content is still coming, and that content over here was all of our lazy loaded content. And I want
to stress that it's running slow here because we're running everything inside of a Plunker and we have not done
any build process whatsoever. When it becomes time to do our deploy of our application, we'll use tools like
AOT, which is an Angular tool to do ahead of time compilation, that'll use the Angular compiler on the server to
compile the templates here and then send across the wire those compile templates. So it doesn't have to do that
in the browser, it'll still get the data on the fly, and that'll make the application faster, and we'll use
things like tree shaking to shake out some of the dead code that we're not using. And we use code splitting so
we can split our bundles up in case we want to use eager or lazy loaded modules. And we'll use things like
bundling and minification and other standard web practices. A lot of these are built into the tools that Angular
is starting to provide. If you want to learn more about these, you can check out the documentation or you can
take a look at the Angular cli, which has this built into it, or check out one of our Angular 2 courses that
covers deployment.</p>

<h3>Feature Module Types</h3>

<p>Our application is made up of various ngModules, Angular modules. These different pieces are features of our
application. We call these feature modules. Earlier we talked about the four basic types of feature modules,
there are domain modules. These are the most basic types of modules, they represent a domain of logic where we
encapsulate a certain feature. These could be our characters are or a menu area with navigation and other pieces
that go with it. We also have routed feature modules. Routed feature modules are actually a type of domain
module. They just have one additional characteristic, they're domain modules that can be routed to. In the
storyline tracker application we have the characters and vehicles ngModules, which are domain and routed feature
modules. The third type of feature modular are the services, these are the ones that hold things like our
logging and our messaging or our exception handling, anything that's a service that we want to use throughout
the application. And the fourth type were widgets. This is where we put our components. We talked about the
kinds of domain modules that we could have. These are typically going to be imported once into our root
application, and there's no routing associated with them. Things like a menu module or navigation module, could
be other examples, domain modules. Once we apply our route to them they become routed domain modules. These are
ones that have a target using a route. So we put some kind of navigation with them. In our application, our
CharactersModule is a routed feature module. What about the service? A service is one that holds different
services we can use. Generally this type of module contain all providers and no components, and we'll import it
once into the app's root module. I often call this the CoreModule because it's core to the application. Things
that should go in here, we talked about being like a logging service or messaging service. Things that probably
wouldn't go in here are components. Why? Because they're going to represent a singleton of our application. And
we'll see when we get to talking about how providers work in modules that this is an important concept. You do
not want to import the CoreModule into other modules. This is key to maintaining it to being a singleton. The
final type are for the widgets. We often have these in applications, these are for our components or directives
or pipes, things that we're going to use across an entire app. I usually call my widget module the SharedModule
and I will import the SharedModule in every other module that needs to use these widgets. Next let's see how our
application can be applied using these feature module types.</p>

<h3>Identifying Feature Modules</h3>

<p>I find it helpful to be able to apply the feature module types to a real application. This helps us identify the
types as our building apps. The dependency chain might look something like this. We're on the left with the
black lines, those four modules are effectively imported into the AppModule. So that AppModule imports the other
four because it needs all of those. It has to have our services out of core, our menu, of course, to show the
menu, and then the characters and vehicles modules so we can get there. And then our SharedModule is actually
used by the characters and vehicles. Those are the widgets that are actually shown on those different pages. Our
MenuModule might have a MenuComponent or maybe other filters or directives. Our CoreModule might have services
in it, things like messaging or exception handling. Our CharactersModule is going to have some routing module in
it and a service for getting characters and maybe components for showing them. Our vehicles will look very
similar, these are the most common in our application and as our application grows, we'll have many of these
different kinds of routed modules. Our SharedModule will contain things that are reusable like a
FilterTextComponent. We may want more than one of these in our application, different instances, or maybe a pipe
that we create. We'll also import commonly used things like the CommonModule and the FormsModule right from
Angular. Why? Because we want the ngIf and the ngFor or ngModel, and we're going to use those throughout the
app. So all of our routed modules will import the SharedModule. Let's look at this a different way. We have our
four basic types of feature modules, domain, routed, service, and widget. Modules must declare their components,
their directives, and their pipes. Of these different types all of them could have declarations but a service
module probably shouldn't. Why? Because we're going to share that across the app and we don't want to share the
same date calendar everywhere because if I choose May 24th on one particular page, we don't want it to have that
same state on another. Service modules, remember, are great for services, not components. What about providers?
Where do services really live? Well they're ideal for service modules. You can use them in the other kinds, but
it's more rare. What do we export from these modules? Do we export anything? A domain module might have some,
routed ones probably wouldn't have any. Why? Because you're routing to them for a reason. They're a type of
domain module and they're usually encapsulating everything they need, so you're not going to be exporting other
modules. Same thing goes for service modules. You've encapsulated those services on purpose so we can import the
entire service module into our app root, and yes, our widget module must export. Why? Because if we're going to
use components inside the widget module and we're going to share them around the app, we have to export them so
the app can use them. Let's look at this from the other angle of who's going to import these modules. Well if we
have a domain module, a feature module might import it. Maybe it happens to be another domain module. Same thing
with widgets, pretty much anybody can import those. The service module should only be imported by the app
module, the root, because we're going to share those across the app, that's part of the core module we talked
about. And routed modules should not be imported by anybody if they're lazy loaded. Let's apply these to
concrete examples. A domain module could be like a menu module or even a character's module and then a
character's module could also be a routed module. A service module, I generally call mine the CoreModule and
make that contain all my services in my app, but another example is the HttpModule that comes from Angular. It
contains a bunch of services we can use. And the widget module examples might be the CommonModule, that's the
thing that comes out of Angular that gives us ngIf and ngFor, and we might create our own SharedModule with our
own components and directives. Now let's go look through our storyline tracker application and we can see
different examples of feature modules.</p>

<h3>Feature Modules in the Storyline Tracker</h3>

<p>Back in the storyline tracker we can identify the different kinds of modules that we talked about. First we have
domain feature modules, things like vehicles. This is our vehicle-module and it contains everything we need to
know about vehicles, our services, our components, and we happen to route to this feature module, which also
makes it a routed feature module. We have other examples of routed feature modules, such as the dashboard. We
route to him as well. He happens to be a little bit smaller than the vehicles module. And we also happen to have
a characters routed feature module. What about those service modules we talked about? Well I like to name mine
core and inside of here you can see a lot of things that are really generic for an app. You might see yourself
creating an exception service or a message service or a user profile service. All these things would have
singletons in your app, usually only have one user logged in or one exception handling service. We define a
core.module at the root of them and that core.module would then import all the different files in there and it
would also re-export the things that it needs to expose. This core.module is an example of as service module.
Now back in our app.module we would import the core.module. Notice down here on line 27, that's one of the
things our app.module gets. Now we have all those services available to the application, without having to
pollute the app.module with a big list of them. So if we go back to our core.module, we should see a bunch of
providers, like the EntityService, the ExceptionService and MessageService. What about a widget module? I like
to call mine shared, we could also call it widget. Inside of here I've got a pipe and I've also got a
filter-text component. And these go into the shared.module. Notice we have declarations of the InitCapsPipe and
I happened to break out the filter-text.component into its own module and it's got a declaration for a
FilterTextComponent, so this module actually gets imported by the shared.module right here on line 17. And all
of those get re-exported on line 18. Now the shared.module is not imported anywhere except where it needs to be
used. It could be imported in the app.module, but the app.module is not using it so we're not bothering with it.
However, the shared module is used by the characters, so if we go to the characters-module, we should see here
importing SharedModule. That way we can take advantage of the pipe and the FilteredTextComponent somewhere in
this module if we need to. And we also might import the shared.module from the vehicles.module, right here on
line 11. So the shared.module gets imported in multiple different places because we may want to use different
instances of that pipe or that component. Now these labels what we've put on the types of feature modules,
they're just labels. But I find it's easier to organize my application and design it by thinking about them in
these terms. The first step of designing the app is taking different components and pipes and services and
things in the application and deciding which ones are like minded or related, they make up your feature modules.
We can then decide which ones are services, which ones are widgets, and which ones are domains or routed
domains. As a reminder, there are just ngModules in Angular. These words we're using, they're not part of
Angular, they're just a way for us to help think about how to divide our application, how to organize it. You'll
find these terms mentioned in the official style guide on the Angular website in their docs.</p>

<h3>Provider Tips</h3>

<p>Sometimes our feature modules have to have providers. We need to make sure their services are available to those
modules. There's a couple important notes I've learned along the way about using providers in feature modules
and I want to share them with you. It's really important to consider how we want those providers to behave in
our system. So let's think about a couple different angles. Let's say we had a component and it's got a bunch of
child components. Now we have a service that's going to be used by all those components, the parent and all the
children, but those are the only things using it. We could provide that service in that parent component, that
makes it accessible to all of its children. An example of this might be a character service that's only used by
the character component and all of its children. However, once we decide we want to use that service outside of
the component tree, this isn't going to work. So a safe example of this might be like a login component. That
login component might use a login service to check to see if you're logged in. Nobody else is going to use the
login service, but that login component. If that's the case, we could provide that login service to the login
component's providers and feel really safe that nobody else needs it. We just talked about putting providers at
the component. More often than not we're going to want to provide at the ngModule level. This will make the
services available to everybody in that module, but keep in mind when you import an ngModule and that ngModule
has providers, anything importing it is going to get a new instance of that service when we do dependency
injection. This is why the CoreModule in our storyline tracker app, which has a bunch of services in it and it
provides those services in that module, is only imported into the app root module. If we imported it somewhere
else we'd get multiple instances of those services and we don't want that. Now that feature is there because
there may be cases where we do want multiple instances, but just be aware of how that works. And as a reminder,
we want to be really careful putting any providers in a module that could imported more than once, this is why
we don't generally put providers in our widget type modules. So let's look at an example. We just mentioned a
login.component. The login.component is probably going to be the only thing that uses the LoginService, and if
that's the case, we could provide that LoginService in its providers, right here. If somebody else has to use
that LoginService, we wouldn't do it here, we'd do at the module level, and that might become part of the core
module. In this case, right here, the LoginService is only used in the component so we provide it at this
component, so the LoginComponent can use it and any child of LoginComponent could also use it. What about module
providers, which are far more common? Here we have the app.module, and notice we have several different
providers listed. There is a RouterGuard for an AuthenticationGuard, CharacterService, UserProfileService and a
VehicleService. These are all different types that could be used throughout the application. So we provide these
to the root injector and this makes them available everywhere in the application. NgModules help us organize our
declarations and our providers. Just keep in mind how those providers work and when in doubt, provide at the
module level. And these are just some tips to help you with providers as you're designing your application.</p>

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>

<p>In this module we learned quite a bit about eager loading and lazy loading of different modules. Whenever we're
routing, we have to decide which of these types we want to use. Eager loading gets them on demand up front, lazy
loading allows us to delay that load so we can front load everything we need for the user with the eager loaded
modules. We can gain better performance out of lazy loaded modules and remove the delay of when a user clicks on
a route and then it has to go fetch that information for the lazy loader module by using preload strategies.
Then we learned how to identify different kinds of feature modules so we can categorize the types of ngModules
we might create and find in an application. This helps us design our application better. And last, we learned
some good tips about using providers inside of our application. All the demos in our application can be found
right here at the angular2-first-look-azurewebsites.net website. Here we'll keep these demos up-to-date as
Angular progresses through Angular 2. I encourage you to click on the examples, play with them, change the code
around, and we can discuss them and live fire on the Pluralsight website. And finally, please check out the
official style guide that I'm helping author on the angular.io website. This is a great place for you to learn
new tips about designing your applications. I truly hope you've enjoyed taking this Angular 2 first look as much
as I've enjoyed presenting it to you. Thank you and have fun with Angular.</p>
