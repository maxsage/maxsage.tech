<h1>Development Web Servers</h1>
<h2>Express</h2><img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/express.png"/>
<p>Express is lightweight but still feature rich. It is highly configurable and can be used for more than just static files. It can be used as a dev and
    production server. If your building API's in Node then this is a big win which makes using Express as your development server an easy choice.

<h2>Browsersync</h2><img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/browsersync.png" height="100" width="158"/>
<p>Browsersync makes your browser testing workflow faster by synchronising URLs, interactions and code changes across multiple devices.</p>
<p>Browsersync automatically sets up a dedicated IP address on you network so that you or anyone that can hit the IP on your LAN can see your app. The second
    feature allows you to hit that IP on multiple devices and all the devices will remain in sync. This is great for cross-device testing. You can think of
    Browsersync as a powerful and free development web server or as a way to augment your existing web server with additional features.

<h2>Setting up Express as a development web server</h2>
<p>Let's use Express as our development web server because it's powerful, configurable and extremely popular.</p>
<p>We already installed express when we ran <code class="hljs">npm install</code> earlier because express is one of the many packages listed in our <code
        class="hljs">package.json</code> file so now we just need to configure express.
</p>
<p>I like to keep all my build related tools in a single folder called <code class="hljs">buildScripts</code> which I keep in the root of the project. In this
    folder create a file called <code class="hljs">srcServer.js</code>.This file will configure a web server that will serve up the files in our src directory.
</p>
<p>Once this file has been created you can issue the following command from a terminal session:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">node buildScripts/srcServer.js</code></pre>
<h2>Sharing Work-in-progress</h2>
<h3>localtunnel</h3><img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/localtunnel.png" height="225" width="225"/>
<p>You can use localtunnel to expose your localhost via a public Url. It punches a hole in your firewall so that your local machine can operate as a web server.
    To get started issue the following command in a terminal session:
</p>
<pre><code>npm install localtunnel -g</code></pre>
<p>Start your web application.</p>
<pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
<p>Use the command line interface to request a tunnel to your local server:</p>
<pre><code>lt --port 3000</code></pre>
<p>Running Browsersync and localtunnel together can be a compelling combination.</p>
