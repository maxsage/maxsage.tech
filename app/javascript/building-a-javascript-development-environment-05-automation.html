    <h1>Automation</h1>
    <p>The automation tool we will use in this course is NPM Scripts. NPM scripts are declared directly in your
      <code class="hljs">package.json</code> file in the <code>scripts</code> section.</p>

    <h2>Creating a startup script using npm scripts</h2>
    <p>In a previous module we created <code class="hljs">srcServer.js</code> which configures express to serve up our
      <code class="hljs">index.html</code>. Now let's create an npm script that will start our development environment.
      By
      convention this script should be called start. That way by convention we can just type <code class="hljs">npm
        start</code>
      and it will run our command. We will just put the exact command that we have been typing manually under our
      scripts section:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="json">"scripts": {
    "start": { "node buildScripts/srcServer.js"
},
</code></pre>
    <p>Now we can just open up our command line and issue the command:</p>
    <pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
    <p>It is also worth noting
      that you do not need to specify the <code class="hljs">run</code> keyword when using <code class="hljs">npm
        start</code> or
      <code class="hljs">npm test</code>. Both of those are so commonly used that <code class="hljs">npm</code> doesn't
      require you to type the
      <code class="hljs">run</code> keyword for either of those scripts.</p>
    <h2>Displaying a friendly message when starting development environment</h2>
    <p>It would be nice if we received a friendly message when starting up our development environment. To do that
      let's create a file in buildScripts called <code class="hljs">startMessage.js</code>:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="hljs javascript">var chalk = require('chalk');
console.log(chalk.green('Starting app in dev mode...'));
</code></pre>
    <p>You can see we are referencing chalk which let's us specify the colour of the output that you display to the
      console.</p>
    <p>You can take advantage of a handy convention to ensure that our <code class="hljs">startMessage.js</code> file
      runs before the web server
      starts up. If we create a script in our <code class="hljs">package.json</code> called <code
        class="hljs">prestart</code> then by convention it will run before
      our start script.</p>
    <pre>
<code class="json">"prestart": "node buildScripts/startMessage.js",
</code></pre>
    <p>npm scripts support convention based pre and post hooks so any scripts you prefix with the word pre will run
      before the script with the same name and any script you prefix with the word post will run after the script with
      the same name.</p>
    <h2>Running node security check from npm scripts</h2>
    <p>Add a script called <code class="hljs">security-check</code> to the scripts section that will run the node
      security
      platform security check:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">"security-check": "nsp-check"</code></pre>
    <p>So this is more typing than simply typing <code class="hljs">nsp check</code> so what are the advantages of this
      method? </p>
    <p>Firstly it is more descriptive to type <code class="hljs">npm run security-check</code> than it is to type <code
      class="hljs">nsp check</code>. Secondly, and most
      importantly, remember how previously we had to install nsp globally so we could run it from a command line. With
      npm
      scripts it is not required to install tools globally in order to run them.</p>
    <p>When you run <code class="hljs">npm install</code> to install all the packages that are listed in
      <code class="hljs">package.json</code> they get added
      to a <code class="hljs">.bin</code> folder which is automatically in path when called from npm scripts. This means
      there is no requirement
      to install these packages globally.</p>
    <p>Adding <code class="hljs">security-check</code> to the npm scripts in <code class="hljs">package.json</code>
      means you can run the security check as
      part of the application startup process if required.</p>
    <h2>Adding localtunnel to the npm scripts</h2>
    <p>Add another npm script called <code class="hljs">share</code> to the scripts section of package.json file:</p>
    <pre><code>"share": "lt --port 3000"</code></pre>
    <h2>Running scripts in parallel</h2>
    <p>The <code class="hljs">pre</code> and <code class="hljs">post</code> hooks are handy for running things before or
      after scripts but you will likely find that you
      also want to run multiple things at the same time. To do that we use a package called <code class="hljs">npm run
        all</code>. This is a handy
      way to run multiple items at the same time in a cross platform way - so in other words it will run on Unix,
      Windows and Linux.</p>
    <p>Let's say that we want to run the security check each time we start the app. To do this we can change our start
      script to instead call <code class="hljs">npm run all</code> specifying that we want to run some tasks in parallel
      (the
      security check and start the web server). We create another script called <code class="hljs">open:src</code> to
      start the
      webserver and call that from our <code class="hljs">start</code> script.</p>
    <pre>
<code class="json">"start": "npm-run-all --parallel security-check open:src",
"open:src": "node buildScripts/srcServer.js"
</code></pre>
    <p>Now if we run <code class="hljs">npm start</code> the web server will be started and our security check will be
      performed. We
      also see the message:</p>
    <pre><code>"Starting app in dev mode..." </code></pre>
    <p>from the pre script that calls <code class="hljs">startMessage.js</code></p>
    <p>You will also notice some other messages appearing. If these messages bother you it is possible to run
      <code class="hljs">npm start -s</code> which stands for silent. This will suppress most of the other messages and
      leave you
      with just the messages that you have explicitly requested.</p>
    <p>I would like to create another task that starts up the web server and shares my work via localtunnel without
      having to start two terminal sessions. To do this let's rename the <code class="hljs">share</code> task to
      <code class="hljs">localtunnel</code>. Next we will create a new script called <code class="hljs">share</code>
      below that will handle the
      entire sharing process.</p>
    <pre><code>"share": "npm-run-all --parallel open:src localtunnel</code></pre>
    <p>We can test this out by opening up the terminal and running <code class="hljs">npm share</code>. You can see the
      web server
      starts and localtunnel starts in parallel.</p>
