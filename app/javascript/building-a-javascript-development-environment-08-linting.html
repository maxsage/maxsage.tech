    <h1>Linting</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>You shouldn't have to keep track of your teams entire list of coding standards in your head. As much as possible
      we should automate the task away and we should be notified immediately when we make a typo. JavaScript linters can
      deliver on both of these concerns. JavaScript linters are so powerful they can catch many errors at compile time.
      It's wonderful finding out that you made a mistake the moment you hit save instead of waiting till runtime to hunt
      some cryptic issue down.</p>
    <p>So in the module we will start by asking why do we need a linter at all? Then we will quickly consider the
      linting
      tools available. We will spend the rest of the module discussing the most popular linter ESLint. We will discuss
      the
      long list of configuration approaches to consider and we will setup linting to run all our rules every time we hit
      save.</p>
    <p>Simple enough - let's get rolling.</p>

    <h2>Why Lint?</h2>
    <p>So why do you need a linter. I see two core reasons. First, a linter programmatically enforces consistency.
      Once you've chosen JavaScript coding standards as a team a linter can help enforce those programmatically and
      provide rapid feedback so issues are caught during development instead of potentially slipping by during code
      reviews.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">
          <h3>Enforce Consistency</h3>
        </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>
          <h3>Avoid Mistakes</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Curly brace position</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Extra parenthesis</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">confirm/alert</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Overwriting function</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Trailing commas</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Assignment in conditional</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Globals</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Missing default case in switch</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">eval</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>debugger/console.log</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Examples include enforcing the position of curly braces or warning about the use of built-in features that
      your team has decided to avoid like confirm and alert. Many teams prefer to use nicely styled dialogue boxes
      instead of the native implementation of these features. Linting helps programmatically restrict their usage.</p>
    <p>Leaving in a trailing comma or forgetting to add a trailing comma if your team prefers trailing commas as a
      a standard, or declaring a global variable or disallowing the use of eval since it is potentially dangerous and
      often misused. All of these are examples of enforcing consistency through a linter</p>
    <p>Second a linter helps avoid mistakes. Just consider the long list of potential mistakes you can make writing
      JavaScript today. Such as adding an extra parenthesis when wrapping a statement or overriding a function when
      you don't realise that the function with the same name already exists. How about performing an assignment in a
      conditional when you almost certainly meant to perform a comparison instead - it's really easy to leave out that
      extra equals sign. Or forgetting to define a default case in a switch statement which can lead to hard to debug
      fall through issues. How about leaving debugging related junk in your code like <code class="hljs">debugger</code>
      or <code class="hljs">console.log</code>. It's easy to accidentally leave these in and have them slip into
      production. With a linter you will know immediately when you do and you can even fail the build on your continuous
      integration server when a developer overlooks warnings and commits any of these issues.</p>
    <p>This list just scratches the surface. So assuming your sold on using a linter the next question is which linter
      linter should you use. Let's explore that in the next clip.</p>


    <h2>Linters</h2>
    <p>Ok now that you're hopefully sold on the benefits it's time to pick a linter.</p>
    <h3>JSLint</h3>
    <p>JSLint was the original, created by Douglas Crockford many years ago. It's extremely opinionated and while
      some consider that a feature the public has largely moved on to more powerful and configurable alternatives
      today.</p>
    <h3>JSHing</h3>
    <p>One such alternative is JSHint. JSHint is an improvement on JSLint which offers more configurability but in
      recent years the most popular linter by far has become ESLint.</p>
    <h3>ESLint</h3>
    <p>ESLint has become so powerful and configurable that I am not aware of any good reason to choose JSLint or JSHint
      anymore. ESLint has become the defacto standard. So bottom line, this choice is really quite easy, my suggestion
      is
      to just use ESLint. Now actually I cant quite say just use ESLint because if you choose to use a language that
      compiles to JavaScript you might have to use an alternative Linter. For example, at the time of this writing, none
      of
      these linters support linting TypeScript although ESLint is expected to add support in the near future. If your
      working in TypeScript then for now you will need to choose TSLint instead. Now that we have chosen ESLint let's
      explore our different options for configuring it in the coming clips.</p>

    <h2>ESLint Configuration Decisions Overview</h2>
    <p>Much like the rest of life in JavaScript land ESLint is filled with decisions. Let's explore some of the key
      decisions we will make configuring it. Choosing ESLint was the easy part, the hard part is the next set of
      decisions we need to make. We need to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>We need to choose a config format?</li>
      <li>We need to decide which built-in rules that we would like to enable?</li>
      <li>We need to decide whether to use warnings or errors?</li>
      <li>We need to consider extending ESLint's power by adding plugins for the framework or your choice.</li>
      <li>Finally if all this sounds overwhelming you can just punt on the whole thing and use a preset instead</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's discuss each of these decisions so you are clear how to configure ESLint best for your needs.</p>
    <h2>Decision 1: Configuration File Format</h2>
    <p>Let's begin with decision 1. Where should you put your configuration. The number of different ways to configure
      ESLint is just plain silly. There are five different filenames that it currently supports for configuration or you
      can add your configuration to package.json. So how do you decide? Well the most common universal approach is to
      create a dedicated .eslintrc file using one of the filename and formats mentioned on the previous slide but
      assuming you are already using npm you can also configure ESLint in package.json. The advantage of configuring
      via a separate file is that it is universal. It is not tied to npm but using package.json avoids using yet another
      file in your application.</p>
    <p>To configure ESLint via package.json add a section called eslintConfig. The contents of this section will be
      the same as the .eslintrc approach and we will walk through the contents of the eslintrc in a moment. </p>
    <h2>Decision 2: Which Rules?</h2>
    <p>After choosing a configuration method decision 2 is: which rules should we enable? ESLint catches dozens of
      potential errors out of the box such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>comma-dangle: require or disallow trailing commas</li>
      <li>no-dupe-args: disallow duplicate arguments in function definitions</li>
      <li>no-extra-semi: disallow unnecessary semicolons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I suggest gathering as a team and deciding once and for all which of these rules are worth enabling. Yes it
      will be a painful meeting but once you get it done and it is in your starter kit, it's settled an you can
      enjoy the benefits.</p>
    <h2>Decision 3: Warnings or Errors?</h2>
    <p>Now that you've decided which rules you want to enable you have yet another decision to make. Which of your
      rules should merely produce warnings and which rules are a big enough deal to justify throwing errors instead.
      Let's consider the implications of Warnings versus Errors.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">
          <h3>Warning</h3>
        </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>
          <h3>Error</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Can continue development</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Breaks the build</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Can be ignored</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Cannot be ignored</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Team must agree: Fix warnings</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Team is forced to comply</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>With a warning it doesn't break the build so you can continue with development without fixing the issue. In
      contrast errors actually break the build which can be helpful when the linter finds a more critical issue that
      should catch your attention immediately and keep you from moving forward. But since warnings don't stop
      development
      they can ultimately be ignored. This is handy in the moment when your focused on implementing a feature and don't
      want to stop your flow to fix a minor issue but it also means that warnings can potentially be committed because
      they may not break the build. Errors, in contrast, are a clear wall to moving forward - they can't be ignored.
      Due to these trade offs I have seen some shops only use warnings because they favour moving as fast as possible
      and
      I have seen other shops use only errors because they favour stopping any work that isn't good enough to commit at
      that moment.</p>
    <p>Now I suggest using both. Warnings are good for minor stylistic issues and errors are useful for items that are
      likely to produce bugs. The bottom line is it's important that your development team agrees that warnings are not
      acceptable. If you commit code that produces warnings then quickly your linting output will get so noisy that it's
      useless and it will mask other helpful output like test results that also display on the same command line.</p>
    <p>If you choose errors then you don't have to worry about people ignoring linting issues. They will be forced to
      comply because the application wont build. In summary I recommend choosing carefully based on context. You'll
      likely decide that only some rules warrant throwing an error versus a warning.</p>
    <h2>Decision 4: Plugins?</h2>
    <p>Now that you have implemented ESLint's built in rules you have another decision to make. Should you enhance
      ESLint with some plugins for your library or framework of choice and if so which ones? For instance I primarily
      work in React and in my React courses you can see how I use eslint-plugin-react to perform a number of additional
      checks that are specific to React and similar plugins are available for other popular frameworks like angular as
      well as for node.js. There is a handy list of ESLint configs, plugins, parsers and more at this url:</p>
    <a href="github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint">github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint</a>
    <p>As you'll see there are plugins for many popular frameworks and libraries available. These plugins are useful
      because they help enforce a consistent style in the way that your team works with the framework of your
      choice.</p>
    <h2>Decision 5: Preset</h2>
    <p>Did those first four decisions feel pretty overwhelming. If so then this option allows you to avoid the
      decisions that I just talked about. Instead you can just decide to use somebody else's preset. There are multiple
      popular ways to handle declaring your ESLint rules. The most obvious option is to start from scratch as we just
      discussed. This way you can take the full list of rules, work through it one by one and build up your own list of
      settings that's perfect for the way your own team want's to do development. </p>
    <p>However, if everything we just talked about sounds like too much work, there is certainly some good ways around
      it. ESLint comes with a preset that implements a logical set of defaults that can save you a lot of time. It
      decides what is an error or warning for you and enables the rules that it thinks make the most sense for most
      people. I prefer to use ESLint's standard rules as a good shortcut to get started then I tend to tweak a few of
      the
      settings based on our team's feedback. This is a nice compromise because it avoids the work of starting from
      scratch but it still offers complete power in tweaking the settings as your team sees fit. You can even go a step
      farther and use an existing set of rules like airbnb, xo or standard js. Assuming that you don't mind decisions
      that they have made this is a great way to avoid spending a lot of time arguing about all the decisions that I
      have
      just discussed. It is also worth noting that standard JS isn't actually a standard! In fact, ironically, many of
      the
      rules that it enforces like disallowing semicolons and only allowing single quotes for strings are actually quite
      unpopular in the JavaScript community.</p>
    <p>All of these options use ESLint but they enforce strong opinions so you don't have to make any decisions
      configuring rules. In fact, with standard JS, you can't change any rules at all. Assuming that you are willing to
      accept the strong opinions in these presets you have a very low friction way to get started. Now that we have
      talked about configuration of ESLint we also need to discuss a couple of issues that are likely to trip you
      up.</p>
    <h2>Watching Files with ESLint</h2>
    <p>Now that we've decided we are using ESLint there are a few different ways to actually run it. Of course the
      simplest way to run ESLint is via the command line, however, there is one obvious limitation with this approach.
      ESLint doesn't currently include a watch setting built in so if you want to automatically run ESLint each time
      that you hit save running ESLint by itself wont work. Here are two ways to get around ESLint's lack of file
      watching capability.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">
          <h3>eslint-loader</h3>
        </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>
          <h3>eslint-watch</h3>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">Re-lints all files upon save.</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>ESLint wrapper that adds file watch</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right"></td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Not tied to webpack</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right"></td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Better warning/error formatting</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right"></td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Displays clean message</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="right"></td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Easily lint tests and build scripts too</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>First, since we are using Webpack one option is to use eslint-loader so webpack will run ESLint each time we
      run our build. The advantage of this approach is all files being bundled by webpack are re-linted every time that
      you hit save so you see an ongoing summary of any linting issues. However, I recommend going a different route
      and using an npm package called eslint-watch.</p>
    <p>This npm package is simply a wrapper around eslint that adds file watching capability. So this stands alone
      and isn't tied to webpack in anyway. So you can use this approach to linting regardless of the bundler that you
      choose. eslint-watch also adds some other nice tweaks like better looking warnings and error messaging and it
      displays a message when linting comes back clean unlike eslint-loader which is completely silent when there are
      not linting issues. Finally, the biggest win with this approach is that you can easily lint all your files even if
      they are not being bundled as part of your app. So this means, you can lint your tests, webpack.config, and any
      build scripts as well. I really like this so that I can ensure that all the code in my project is held to the same
      standard and has a consistent style.</p>
    <h2>Linting Experimental Features</h2>
    <p>Another issue you may run into is ESLint doesn't support many experimental JavaScript features at this time.
      Now ESLint supports all of ES6 and ES7 natively and is expected to continue adding support for standardized
      features as JavaScript progresses. It also supports object spread even though that is currently an experimental
      feature. What if you want to use other experimental JavaScript features? Well then you will likely want to
      use babel-esLint instead because it also lints stage 0-4 features.</p>
    <p>You can view links to the different
      experimental JavaScript features under the plugins page on Babels web site. As you can see JavaScript features
      progress through different stages. They are initially just ideas which are stage 0. Stage 1 is a formal proposal.
      Stage 2 is a draft spec. Stage 3 is a completed spec with initial browser implementations. So as you can see
      risk goes down as the stages progress. Bottom line, if you want to use these experimental features you'll want
      to use babel-eslint. For this course I am going to use only standardized JavaScript features so we will use
      plain ESLint and run it via eslint-watch. Of course if you choose to use experimental features you will need
      to configure Babel with the appropriate plugins to transpile your code as well.</p>
    <h2>Why Lint Via an Automated Build?</h2>
    <p>Now as we've been talking through this process you might be wondering why we should be bothering to lint via an
      automated build process because many editors offer ESLint integration built in so they just monitor your code and
      output results inline right there within the editor. However I prefer to integrate ESLint with my build process
      for multiple reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Outputting all feedback on my code to the command line gives me one single place to check for all the
        feedback related to my code quality. This means I have one place to check, not just for linting issues, but also
        any compile time errors or any testing errors.
      </li>
      <li>This is especially helpful on teams where developers use
        different editors. We all have the same development workflow because we all utilize the same starter kit and
        a command line. Pair programming is also easier when everyone has the same development process.
      </li>
      <li> Most importantly
        ESLint should be part of your build process so that the build is broken on your continuous integration server
        when someone commits any code that commits a linting error. This helps protect your application from slowly
        getting sloppy. Even if a developer ignores ESLint locally the build can be rejected automatically by your
        continuous integration server.
      </li>
      ,
    </ol>
    <h2>Demo: ESLint Set Up</h2>
    <p>Alright let's jump back into the editor and configure ESLint so that we get rapid feedback as we code. We just
      went over a long list of decisions so here's the plan: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are going to use ESLint's built in rules so we don't have to waste time.</li>
      <li>We will use eslint-watch to add watch capability so that our files are linted and reported to the command
        line the moment that we hit save.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To help us quickly catch mistakes, maintain consistency and enforce best practices we are going to use ESLint to
      lint our code. Every time that we hit save it will run. To configure ESLint we can either place a .estlintrc file
      in the root of our project or we can configure it in our package.json. I prefer the separate file so lets create
      a .eslintrc.json.</p>
    <p>As a quick note in my previous course on React and Redux in ES6 I used .eslintrc file without an
      extension but recently ESLint has declared a filename without an extension to be deprecated so I have added the
      .json extension that you see here.</p>
    <p>To get the rules that we are going to use I recommend coming over to GitHub Gist at this shortened url:</p>
    <a href="http://bit.ly/jsdeveslint">bit.ly/jsdeveslint</a>
    <pre>
 <code class="json">{
  "root": true,
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings"
  ],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 7,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "mocha": true
  },
  "rules": {

  }
}
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      So lets walk through our eslintrc.json file. First you can see that I am declaring this as the root eslint file.
      By default ESLint will look for configuration files in all parent folders up to the root directory. So just in
      case you have a eslint file in some parent directory I am adding this for safety. This tells eslint that this is
      the project root so it shouldn't look in any parent folders for other configuration files. So this will help
      assure that you don't get odd behaviour, this will be the only eslint file applying to our project. As you can
      see we are using ESLint's recommended rules. This enables many warnings and errors based on ESLints
      recommendation. As we saw in the slides we could of course use alternatives like airbnb's rules as a baseline
      if preferred.</p>
    <p>We can also augment the recommended settings with plugins that provide enhanced linting. In our
      case I am going to add plugins for enhanced linting of ES6 imports. This assures that if we create an invalid
      import statement we'll find out about it the moment we hit save.</p>
    <p>Now the parser option section defines the version of JavaScript that we are using. We're using ES7 also known
      as ES2016 since that is the latest standard at the time of this recording. I am declaring that we are using
      standard JavaScript modules.</p>
    <p>The environment section declares some different environments that ESLint should be aware of. These environments
      tell ESLint to expect certain global variables. As you can see we are expecting to work with the browser, node,
      and to run our tests with mocha. Now if you view the full list of environments on ESLint you can see that many
      other frameworks are listed including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>QUnit</li>
      <li>Jasmine</li>
      <li>Jest</li>
      <li>A variety of other environments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally we can define any rules that we want to override down at the bottom of the file. Let's add a single rule
      just so you can see how to override ESLint's standard rules:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="json">
"rules": {
  "no-console": 1
}
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>I am going to set no-console to a warning. 1 means warning, 2 means error and 0 means off. So if you feel
      strongly about a rule you can set it to 2 and break the build but since writing to the console can be useful
      during development I prefer to set this to a warning so it doesn't break the build. </p>
    <p>Alright, now we have ESLint configured let's set it up to run via an npm script in our package.json file.</p>
    <p>Now we could simply run eslint directly in an npm script but eslint lacks watch functionality so we will use a
      handy npm package called eslint-watch. eslint-watch adds file watching functionality to eslint and also offers
      enhanced command line output. So let's create an npm script that calls eslint-watch:</p>
    <pre><code class="json">"lint": "esw webpack.config.* src buildScripts",</code></pre>
    <p>We will call it <code class="hljs">lint</code> and we'll call <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code> and we want
      it to watch <code class="hljs">webpack.config.*</code> since soon we will be adding a production version of our
      <code class="hljs">webpack.config</code>, we want it to watch everything in <code class="hljs">src</code> and
      also everything within our <code class="hljs">buildScripts</code> folder. So this should effectively lint all of
      our JavaScript.</p>
    <p>So to clarify <code class="hljs">esw</code> is the executable for
      <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code> and we're just passing <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code> the list of
      files we would like it to watch.</p>
    <p>Here is an important point that can trip you up. If your editor has linting built in be sure to disable it.
      Otherwise your editors built in linting may override the rules that we are going to define.</p>
    <p>Now we should be ready to run this on the command line:</p>
    <pre><code>npm run lint</code></pre>
    <p>We can see that we do get some errors back from <code class="hljs">srcServer.js</code> and
      <code class="hljs">startMessage.js</code>. Since we configured ESLint to throw a warning for the
      <code clas="hljs">no-console</code> rule rather than an error which is the default in the ESLint recommended
      rules. You can see that it currently just displaying black text but if we come back to
      <code class="hljs">package.json</code> and add <code class="hljs">--color</code> on the end of the lint command
      this will tell lint to display our issues with colors.</p>
    <img src="asdf"/>
    <p>Now we get nice yellow warnings here and some color here on our counts on the right. Now this first linting
      error is from srcServer.js and it is complaining about the line where we are writing to the console:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">console.log(err);</code></pre>
    <p>One way that I can handle this is just to add a comment to the top of this file that disables this rule in this
      file since I am ok with writing to the console in any buildScript files. I just want to make sure that I am not
      writing to the console in my actual application. So we can see that this fixed one of the linting issues.</p>
    <p>Now we can go to <code class="hljs">startMessage.js</code> and we can see that we are writing to the console:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">console.log(chalk.green('Starting app in dev mode...'));</code></pre>
    <p>The other way to disable this is to put in a comment at the end of the line:</p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">// eslint-disable-line no-console</code></pre>
    <p>This tells ESLint to disable the rule specified (<code class="hljs">no-console</code> in this example). So
      this can be useful when there are rare exceptions to the rule that we've defined.</p>
    <p>So now if we run <code class="hljf">npm run lint</code> again we should see that linting comes back clean:</p>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
    <p>And it does, it reports back clean with this nice green arrow. This is another I like about
      <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code> is that we get confirmation that it is clean. I like this little extra
      piece of output. </p>
    <p>Linting is now running as expected but it is only running once and then stopping so let's set it up to watch
      our files in the next clip.</p>
    <h2>Demo: Watching Files</h2>
    <p>Let's create another handy script. Oddly <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code> doesn't watch our files by
      default. Instead you have to pass it a command line flag to enable watch. So let's create a separate npm script
      that will watch our files. We'll call it <code class="hljs">lint:watch</code></p>
    <pre><code class="json">"lint:watch": npm run lint -- --watch",</code></pre>
    <p>So we're passing the watch flag along to our existing lint script. So this is saying run the
      <code class="hljs">npm lint</code> script but pass the watch flag to <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code>. So
      let's hit save and see if it works:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs">npm run lint:watch</code></pre>
    <p>So now if I come over to srcServer.js and take out the disable comment we can see ESLint re-runs immediately and
      throws a warning about me using the console statement in the file</p>
    <p>So now we have linting watching our files and now that linting is setup we will know when we make many common
      mistakes in our code. The linting errors will display immediately in our console when we hit save. Now there is
      one final piece that is missing here. We'd like ESLint to run each time that we start our app so we just need to
      add our <code class="hljs">lint:watch</code> task to our start script in <code class="hljs">package.json</code>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="json">"start": "npm-run-all --parallel security-check open:src lint:watch",</code></pre>
    <p>And it will run in parallel since we are already using <code class="hljs">npm-run-all</code> and telling it
      to run any of the scripts that we list on the right in parallel.</p>
    <p>Now if I type:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs">npm start -s</code> </pre>
    <p>We should see that linting is part of our start now. We get our message, we get our security check and there
      our linting is running as well.</p>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
    <p>So now when we type <code class="hljs">npm start</code> it displays the start message, runs webpack, starts our
      development web server, opens the app in our default browser, lints our files and reruns webpack and eslint
      anytime
      that we hit save. That's a lot of power in so little code. Let's wrap up this module with a quick summary.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In this module we saw two core reasons to lint.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enforce consistency</li>
      <li>Avoid mistakes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Linting helps enforce consistency so that our code is easier to read and it helps us avoid many common
      mistakes related to typos, globals and accidental assignments. We saw that there are multiple linters but we
      chose ESLint because it is currently the most popular, configurable and extensive linter available. </p>
    <p>We reviewed a variety of configuration choices including: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Config format</li>
      <li>Which rules?</li>
      <li>Warnings vs errors?</li>
      <li>Which plugins?</li>
      <li>Use preset instead?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We wrapped up by our enhancing our development environment to use ESLint's recommended rules and run
      ESLint every time we hit save using <code class="hljs">eslint-watch</code>. </p>
    <p>Our development environment is really coming together now but we haven't covered a critical aspect yet. What
      about testing and continuous integration. Let's explore these topics in the next module.</p>
