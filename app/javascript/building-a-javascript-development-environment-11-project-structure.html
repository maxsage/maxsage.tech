    <h1>Project Structure</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>It's been a long road but we're well on our way to enjoying a seriously robust, comprehensive and luxurious
      JavaScript development experience. But we still have two major pieces left to consider in these final two modules.
      In this module let's discuss how to put all this to use by discussing project structure. In this short module I
      want to begin by explaining why I believe your teams starter kit should include a demo application. Then
      we'll move on to discuss three specific project structure tips to keep in mind as your building not just demo
      app but any future JavaScript app. Alright let's begin with my sales pitch on why your team needs a demo app.</p>
    <h2>Why a Demo App?</h2>
    <p>I believe a demo app should be considered a critical piece of your teams starter kit. Why? Because many people
      work best by example so a working example really helps. Let's just review some decisions which are clearly
      conveyed via an example app. A demo app conveys expectations around suggest directory structure and file
      organization. It helps encourage consistency by codifying patterns for how developers should work with the
      libraries and frameworks that you've selected. It shows example tests that are passing so developers have a point
      of reference for various testing scenarios, naming conventions, file placement and mocking strategies. It
      provides a realistic example of a mocking api working in your domain. This gives developers a big head start
      since referencing examples is often quicker than pulling up docs for disparate packages. It provides a
      working automated deployment so there's already a clear recipe for use for future apps. It gives you a single
      place to codify your decisions the demo app should reflect your coding standards. It's a place to update as you
      learn new techniques and patterns that your want to share with the team. Finally and perhaps most importantly it
      offers an interactive example of the starter kit working in a realistic scenario. This helps new team members
      understand what life is like working in the selected stack. Ok so assuming your on board with creating a demo
      app for your teams starter kit let's consider a few tips for structuring JavaScript projects in the next
      clips.</p>
    <h2>Tip 1: JS Belongs in a .js File</h2>
    <p>Before we build the demo app let's take a moment to consider project structure. I have three important tips I
      want to share to help you avoid some of the pitfalls that I often see in JavaScript code bases. My first tip is
      simple</p>
    <ol>
      <li>JavaScript belongs in a .js file.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>But when doing web development some of you are tempted to simply slap JavaScript code in a script tag. Of
      course you'd never do that right? It's understandable. It's so easy just to slap a script tag onto the HTML
      page and start coding. But let's pause for a moment and consider why this should be avoided. There's a long
      list of downsides. When I do something like this:</p>
    <pre>
<code>&lt;script&gt;
  // slap code here
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>The answer is I'm losing a ton of power to do my job better. I'm losing the ability to leverage all of the
      goodness that I just setup. See if I do this how do I write automated tests for this, how do I lint this code,
      how do I reuse this. Oh and if you just mumbled copy and paste - wrong answer! Now what if I want to use ES6,
      TypeScript or some alternative language that transpiles to JavaScript. What if I want to be explicit about
      my codes dependencies by using ES6's import keyword. The answer to all of these questions is - you can't. By
      putting your code inline within HTML your'e losing all of this power. And these are just a few of the
      fundamental issues with this approach. So my advice comes down to a simple maxim. JavaScript belongs in a .js
      file. Writing JavaScript inline within an HTML file should be avoided. And please for the sake of everyone's
      sanitydon't use some server side language to generate your JavaScript. This example from StackOverflow makes me
      want to cry tears of mourning for the maintenance programmer:</p>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
    <p>Let's just think about the developer experience here. All of the code is the same color, there is no auto
      completion support. Your editor can't highlight any typos so you won't find out about your mistakes until
      runtime. And you don't get to enjoy any of the goodness that we've worked so hard to setup in this course. Yet
      I see this pattern all too often when server side developers who are new to JavaScript need to perform some
      custom logic based on data that's in the database. So let me clarify a better way to get that done. If you need
      your code to respond differently for different users, instead inject JSON from the server into your application. I
      call this the object configuration pattern. Now I'm far from the only person suggesting this pattern. As you can
      see StackOverflow is using it here:</p>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
    <p>Since StackOverflow is using C# behind the scenes you can imagine that there's a C# class that contains all of
      this data, likely pulled from their database. And they use a JSON serializer in C# likely JSON .net to generate
      this JSON. Their static JavaScript code looks at this JSON and this is what customizes my StackOverflow
      experience.
      Bottom line: avoid dynamically generating JavaScript code. Instead, dynamically generate some data that your
      JavaScript code can use. And this really shouldn't come as any surprise. We don't generate custom C#, Java, Ruby
      or
      Python and so on just to dynamically provide custom behaviour for each user. Instead we pull data from the
      database
      and we use that data to determine what logic should run. JavaScript is no different. The solution is to use data
      from the server to fork your codes logic as necessary.</p>
    <h2>Tip 2: Consider Organizing by Feature</h2>
    <p>Time for my second tip. On larger more complex projects consider organizing by feature instead of by file type.
      There are two popular ways to organize your code.</p>
    <p>By file type</p>
    <pre>
<code class="hljs">
/components
/data
/models
/views
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>or by feature:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="hljs">
/authors
/courses
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>When you organize by file type all files that serve the same purpose are placed together. This is a popular
      approach when working with MVC frameworks which commonly expect you to use Model, View and Controller folders
      to organize your application. However the downside of this approach is you end up having to bounce around the
      file system to open and work with related files. So I recommend organizing by feature on larger projects. The
      larger the project the more organizing by feature pays off because you can go directly to the feature that
      you are working with and all the related files are sitting inside.</p>
    <h2>Tip 3: Extract Logic to POJOs</h2>
    <p>My third tip is to strive to extract as much logic as possible into plain old JavaScript. Some would call this
      POJO's. When I say POJO I mean Plain Old JavaScript Objects. Java and C# developers would recognize this term
      since Java developers also use the term POJO to describe Java classes that have plain logic inside and no
      framework specific concerns. .Net developers use the term POCO to describe the same thing, though in that case it
      stands for Plain Old CLR Object. The point is these files should contain plain logic that isn't tied to any
      framework. When structuring your application strive to place as much logic as possible in plain JavaScript. For
      instance if your working in React much of your logic should exist outside of React components. This makes your
      logic easy to test, easy to reuse and helps minimize your ties to the framework you've selected. This minimizes
      the impact of switching to a different framework down the road. Because, hey, we're in JavaScript, let's face the
      facts - we'll probably be doing that.</p>
    <p>To see an example of this philosophy check out the demo app in the React slingshot starter kit on GitHub. You'll
      see that key logic such as date formatting and core calculations are handled in plain JavaScript in a folder
      called utils. Although this project uses React these are plain JavaScript functions that are'nt tied to React in
      anyway.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Let's wrap up. It's really helpful to include a working example app in your starter kit. This gives everyone
      clarity on recommended approaches for directory structure, file naming, framework usage, testing, api calls,
      deployment and more. It provides an interactive example of what it's like to work on your team. Then we moved
      on to a few ground rules for structuring your project. Put y.our JavaScript in a JavaScript file. This
      principle is foundational. If you place JavaScript inline within HTML you lose all the benefits we've worked so
      hard to setup throughout the course. </p>
    <p>Consider organizing your demo app by feature instead of file type. Especially if your team typically builds
      large and complex JavaScript applications.</p>
    <p>And third, extract your logic into Plain Old Javascript Objects. Avoid embedding to much logic in framework
      specific files. Extract your logic to pure functions that are easily testable. I recommend building your demo
      app using your preferred JavaScript frameworks and libraries and be sure to select a domain that's related to
      your business. Keep these tips in mind as you structure your demo app. Alright, there's one very important piece
      left. We need to prepare our app for production. So in the next module let's create an automated production build
      including minification, bundling, bundle splitting and more.</p>
