    <h1>Choosing a Transpiler</h1>
    <p>Modern JavaScript is great but you don't have to write your application using JavaScript. You can choose from a
      long list of Transpilers - there are literally over one hundred languages that compile down to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>The standout options from this list are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Babel</li>
      <li>TypeScript</li>
      <li>Elm</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Babel</h2>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/babel.png"/>
    <p>Babel's selling point is that it allows you to use all the new features of JavaScript (even those that are
      still experimental) in a standards based way. Babel transpiles the latest version of JavaScript down to ES5 so
      you can use all these new features but run them everywhere ES5 is supported. Some of the advantages of Babel
      are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write standardized JS</li>
      <li>Leverage full JS Ecosystem</li>
      <li>Use experimental features earlier</li>
      <li>No type defs, annotation required</li>
      <li>ES6 imports are statically analyzable</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>TypeScript</h2>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/typescript.png"/>
    <p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript so just as ES6 added features to JavaScript TypeScript adds additional
      functionality to JavaScript. Most notably, type annotations which add type safety. This type safety means you
      can enjoy rich auto completion support and safer refactoring by leaning on explicit type signatures. Some of the
      advantages of TypeScript are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced Autocomplete</li>
      <li>Enhanced readability</li>
      <li>Safer refactoring</li>
      <li>Additional non-standard features</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have found that both type safety and auto completion are quite good when working in a modern editor like
      WebStorm. Remember because ES6 imports are statically analyzable the editor can deterministically index your
      entire codebase and thus provide reliable intellisense support on import and the functions inside.</p>
    <h2>Configuring Babel</h2>
    <p>Babel offers two methods for configuration: a dedicated <code class="hljs">.babelrc</code> file placed in the
      project's root or placing the
      configuration within the <code class="hljs">package.json</code> file. The differences between the two methods are:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td align="right">
          <p>.babelrc</p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>Not npm specific</li>
            <li>Easier to read since isolated</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
        <td></td>
        <td align="left">
          <p>package.json</p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>One less file in your project</li>
            <li>Place the configuration in a section called babel</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>For this course I am going to transpile our build scripts as well so we can enjoy modern JavaScript when writing
      our build tooling.</p>
    <p>Lets set up our project to transpile our code the moment we hit save. Since we have decided to use the latest
      version of JavaScript in this project we need to ensure it transpiles down to ES5 to ensure it runs in
      environments
      that don't yet fully support the latest versions of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Create a new file in the root of the project called <code class="hljs">.babelrc</code>. If we look in
      <code class="hljs">package.json</code>
      we can see a number of babel related packages.</p>
    <p>To configure babel doesn't actually take much code. All we need to do is declare one preset that specifies we
      are using the latest standardized JavaScript features (ES 2016 at this time):</p>
    <pre>
<code class="json">{
  "presets": [
    "latest"
  ]
}</code></pre>
    <p>Let's confirm this works by using <code class="hljs">babel-node</code> to transpile one of our build scripts. All
      of our code is currently
      written in ES5 but let's load up <code class="hljs">startMessage.js</code> and change one item to ES6. Currently
      we are using the common js
      pattern which is used for node but we can now use the module syntax instead: </p>
    <pre><code class="javascript">import chalk from 'chalk';</code></pre>
    <p>If we call <code class="hljs">npm run</code> now the build will fail because we are calling some code that node
      doesn't
      understand (the <code class="hljs">import</code> keyword). To fix this we can call <code
        class="hljs">babel-node</code> in our <code class="hljs">prestart</code>
      script instead of calling <code class="hljs">node</code> directly.</p>
    <p>So now we know babel is successfully transpiling our build script. We can also modify the <code
      class="hljs">open:src</code>
      script to run <code class="hljs">babel-node</code> as well. We can then edit <code
        class="hljs">srcServer.js</code> to use the <code class="hljs">import</code> style syntax for
      JavaScript modules and the <code class="hljs">const</code> keyword which was introduced in ES6 as well.</p>
