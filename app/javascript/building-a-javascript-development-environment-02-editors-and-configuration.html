    <h1>Editors</h1>
    <h2>WebStorm</h2>
    <p>There is a wonderful selection of powerful editors these days but the one I will use is WebStorm:</p>
    <img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/webstorm.jpg" height="225" width="225"/>
    <p>WebStorm is many peoples favourite but it is also the only paid option on this list.</p>
    <h2>.editorconfig</h2>
    <p>In WebStorm, VSCode etc. you can drop a file named <code class="hljs">.editorconfig</code> and place it in the
      root of your project you can
      specify how your editor should handle common settings such as tabs v spaces, indent size, line feeds, char sets
      and trailing white space.</p>

       <script src="bundle.js"></script>
