<h1>Package Managers</h1>
<h2>What is a Package Manager?</h2>
<p>A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer, and allows you to easily install new software, upgrade software to newer
    versions, or remove software that you previously installed. As the name suggests, package managers deal with packages: collections of files that are bundled
    together and can be installed and removed as a group.
</p>
<p>Packages contain metadata, such as the software's name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary
    for the software to run properly. Upon installation, metadata is stored in a local package database. Package managers typically maintain a database of
    software dependencies and version information to prevent software mismatches and missing prerequisites. They work closely with software repositories, binary
    repository managers, and app stores.
</p>
<p>These days virtually every popular language has it's own package manager - yet JavaScript soldiered on for years without any compelling package management
    story.
</p>
<p>Thankfully these days we have a variety of JavaScript package manager's to choose from including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bower</li>
    <li>npm</li>
    <li>JSPM</li>
    <li>Jam</li>
    <li>volo</li>
</ul>
<h3>npm</h3><img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/npm.png" height="149" width="338"/>
<p>npm has matured by fixing friction points for front end developers. Node has grown enormously in popularity and bundlers have continued to become more
    powerful. Today npm is the most popular JavaScript package manager. We will use npm for the remainder of this course.
</p>
<h2>Installing Node and npm</h2>
<p>We are going to install Node and npm. We will also create a <code class="hljs">package.json</code> file that is going to store the references to all the
    packages that we are going to use for our development environment.
</p>
<h3>Installing Node</h3><img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png" height="176" width="287"/>
<p>Browse to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a> and download Node. npm will be installed along with Node.</p>
<h3>Adding package.json</h3>
<p>Node's package manifest is <code class="hljs">package.json</code>. <code class="hljs">package.json</code> stores the list of npm packages that we are using,
    as well as the npm scripts which we will end up setting up later. The top of a <code class="hljs">package.json</code> file defines the following items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>name - the name of the project</li>
    <li>version - the version of the project</li>
    <li>description - a description of the project</li>
    <li>scripts - scripts (which we will add later) to help automate our processes</li>
    <li>author - the author(s) of the project</li>
    <li>license - the license model for this project</li>
    <li>dependencies - a list of production dependencies</li>
    <li>devDependencies - a list of development dependencies (npm packages with version numbers)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have a <code class="hljs">package.json</code> file let's install the npm packages. Open a terminal session and type:</p>
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
<p>This will take a minute or two to download all the packages specified in the <code class="hljs">package.json</code> file and place them in a folder called
    <code class="hljs">node_modules</code> in your project directory.
</p>
<h2>Package Security</h2>
<p>It's worth remembering that packages can be published to npm by anyone. That might make you a bit paranoid. However there are people working on this problem
    - retire.js and The Node Security Platform are two ways that you can check your project's dependencies for know vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>Node Security Platform is my preference at this time. It offers a simple command line interface that you can use to automate checking for security
    vulnerabilities. All you need to do is call <code class="hljs">nsp check</code> as part of your build.
</p>
<p>Later in the course we are going to run <code class="hljs">nsp check</code> when we run <code class="hljs">npm start</code>. Admittedly this will slow the
    start time slightly but it has the advantage of notifying you quickly when a security issue exists.
</p>
<p>To install The Node Security Project globally issue the following command from a terminal session:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g nsp</code></pre>
<p>Once the installation is complete you can run a security check for your current project by issuing the following command from a terminal session in your
    project directory:
</p>
<pre><code>nsp check</code></pre>
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
