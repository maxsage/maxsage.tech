<h1>Production Deploy</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Congratulations on making it to the final module. We're finally ready to discuss the last missing piece:
  production deployment. We'll begin this final module by discussing the merits of separating the user interface
  from your applications api into completely separate projects. We'll briefly discuss the wide variety of
  cloud hosting providers. Then we'll create an automated deployment for both the UI and the API using popular
  cloud service providers. We'll wrap up the course by discussing approaches for keeping existing projects
  updated as your starter kit is enhanced over time. And I'll quickly provide some tips for further inspiration
  as you start designing your own development environment. And I'll close out the course with a short challenge.
  Alright, let's dig in and wrap this up. </p>
<h2>Separating the UI from the API</h2>
<p>Throughout the course we've hosted our production api in the same project as our front end. This was useful
  for keeping our demo app simple but I don't necessarily recommend doing this in a real app. Instead, I prefer
  to keep the front end and the api in completely separate projects. Here's why:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, a static front end is easy to deploy. You just need to upload the static files that we wrote to
    the dist folder to a public web server. And since your only uploading the UI you don't have to worry about
    regressing your service layer in anyway - they're completely separate.
  </li>
  <li>Second, it separates concerns. It provides you the ability to have separate teams building the front and
    the back end in parallel without stepping on each others toes. The UI team can code against the mock api that
    we setup and when the real api is ready they can point there instead. Assuming that you have separate people
    focus on the UI and the API your application becomes easier to understand because a given developer can
    focus on one of these two concerns in isolation. This clear separation also means that you can scale the
    backend separately. This is especially useful when you create an api that's going to be consumed by
    multiple applications since the traffic for the api may dramatically differ from the UI's traffic.
  </li>
  <li>A static UI is also cheap to host. When your front end is just static html, javascript and CSS you can
    select virtually any host in the world because all you need is a host that can server static files. In fact
    a static front end can be served from a Content Delivery Network also known as a CDN for short. Content
    Delivery Networks handle caching and scalability for you.
  </li>
  <li>A CDN is especially useful for high traffic sites and applications that are used around the world.
    Since CDN's intelligently serve assets from the closest physical server to speed downloads.
  </li>
  <li>Finally hosting separately of course means that your free to use whatever technology that you like for
    the backend.Our API is currently built using JavaScript but if your team prefers to build API's in a
    different language like C#, Java, Ruby and so on. Keeping the UI and API separate gives you that option.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>And now that I have set the stage for separating the UI and the API let's talk about automated deployments.</p>
<h2>Cloud Hosting</h2>
<p>Of course, the first question when considering an automated deployment is - where should we host the app?
  Virtually any cloud host can serve a JavaScript app these days with minimal configuration. Popular services
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
  <li>Microsoft Azure</li>
  <li>Heroku</li>
  <li>Firebase</li>
  <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
  <li>Netlify</li>
  <li>Github pages</li>
  <li>Surge</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these services offer the power to do far more than just host a JavaScript app. Although Netlify,
  Github pages and Surge are unique options on this list because they're focused solely on serving static files.
  The process for automated deployment will differ by hosting provider. For this module I'm going to host the
  API and User Interface separately. For the API I'll use Heroku because it's popular, powerful and has an
  elegant automated deployment process. For the user interface I'll use Surge because it's simple to setup
  and unlike many of these other options it's focused solely on hosting static files which is what our
  automated build for the UI generates. </p>
<h2>Demo: Automated API Deploy via Heroku</h2>
<p>Alright, back to the editor. Let's setup an automated deployment of our API to Heroku. We're going to create
  a completely separate project for handling this to show how we can host and manage our UI and API separately. As
  I just discussed there are many benefits to completely separating your UI and API projects. In our example app,
  we created an API end point hosted via express. So we need to select a node friendly host for the API. Let's
  host our API on Heroku. Heroku offers a really slick setup for automated deployments that integrates with
  github and it offers a free option that's perfect for showcasing an automated deployment. Heroku's docs already
  do an excellent job of walking you through setting up an account and creating a new NodeJS project. If you go to
  their docs here on heroku.com and click on NodeJS and then click on Getting Started on Heroku with Node.js.
  So if you want to follow along with me please pause this video and go through the introduction and setup
  steps on the Node.js getting started page then come back here to continue. Ok for the rest of this clip I'm
  going to assume that you signed up for Heroku and walked through the introduction and setup steps for Node.js.
  On step three of their setup process which is called prepare the app Heroku provides a link to a sample app
  which you can clone. However instead of using this I created a separate starter kit for you that will work
  well with Heroku. This repository contains a slightly modified version of Heroku's starter kit that includes
  our api so this should help you get started quickly. If you want to use this repository to follow along just
  click Fork up here to fork the repository. This will make sure that you have a completely separate copy that
  you can work with to make sure that you have the proper rights to work with it in Heroku. Now I already have
  this repository pulled down on my local machine so let's jump back to VSCode and walk through it.</p>
<p>As usual be sure to run <code class="hljs">npm install</code> after forking the api repo. There are only
  five files in this repository so let's review each.</p>
<p>First package.json contains only two dependencies: express and cors. We'll use cors to enable cross origin
  calls since we'll be calling our Heroku based api from a different domain. Make sure that repository field
  down here points to your repository if you create your own:</p>
<img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
<p>And there's only one npm script necessary that starts the app.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">"start": "node index.js"</code> </pre>
<p>index.js should look quite familiar to you. It's a slightly modified version of the dist server that we
  created in the previous module. To keep things simple I'm using the CommonJS style up here on line 1 to
  require express since that's the syntax that node understands:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var express = require('express');</code></pre>
<p>I'm also referencing the cors package which we're enabling down here to make ensure that we can call
  the Heroku based api from our UI which will be hosted on a different Url. To clarify this is
  necessary because Cross Origin Resource Sharing must be enabled to make Ajax calls to a different domain.
  We could of course transpile and bundle our code in this project but I'm keeping this project as simple
  as possible so that you can see how to work with Heroku. </p>
<p>If you diff this file with the diff server that we setup in the previous module you'll also notice that
  we're calling open to open a browser there. However this just starts up express and displays a message to
  the console. So to try this out you'll need to open the Url in your browser manually. I also left out
  GZip compression. Again just to try and keep this as simple as possible. Ok this leaves us with two new
  files that help us configure our app for Heroku. The first is app.json which describes our app to Heroku.
  There are many potential properties that we can define here but we're going to keep our app.json simple.
  We'll just define the name, a description, the repository where our project can be found and then a few
  keywords. </p>
<p>The other new file here is Procfile. The Procfile declares the command that Heroku should run.
  That's why there's just one line here. We're telling Heroku to run node on our index.js file. And this is all
  that Heroku needs to host our Node and express based API. Now, of course, Im deliberately leaving out all
  the complexities of testing, transpiling, linting, bundling and more in this project so that you can
  clearly see what it takes to create an automated deployment to Heroku. But of course you can feel free to
  start adding those in once your comfortable with hosting on Heroku. So now we should be ready to complete
  an automated deploy to Heroku. I've already signed up for Heroku and installed the Heroku CLI. So now
  let's open up the terminal and type</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">heroku login</code></pre>
<p>At this point you'll be prompted for your email and your Heroku password. And after entering your
  credentials you should see your email listed in blue which shows that you are logged in successfully. And note
  that you may receives some warnings about file permissions so consider tightening file permissions for
  security if you like. Now it's time to configure our app to work with Heroku so we can type:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">heroku create</code></pre>
<p>This will prepare Heroku to receive our app. This command returns a Url and if we load it we can see a
  welcome message. Heroku generates a random name for your app or you can pass a parameter to specify your
  own name.</p>
<p>Now that we've created our app we need to configure a git remote that points to our Heroku application.
  So let's go back to the command line and we'll say:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">heroku git:remote -a mysterious-dawn-16770</code></pre>
<p>We'll pass it the name of the app that we were assigned right up here. And now that we've set the git
  remote we should be ready to publish the app. We can say:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">git push heroku master </code></pre>
<p>We can see the deployment output as it builds the source and pushes our app up to Heroku it displays
  the random url where our app is hosted so you'll have a different url than me if you're following along. And
  of course for a real app you'll want to specify a domain name that you've registered. But for now we should
  be able to take this url and go over to the browser and when I load it up:</p>
<img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
<p>There we go. We can see our Hello World. And if I go to /users I can see the Json coming back for our
  users so we have our api now hosted in production. And anytime that we make changes to our API we'll just
  commit our changes and then run:</p>
<pre><code>git push heroku master</code></pre>
<p>To be able to push our changes up to Heroku. Heroku will take the code from Github and deploy it to our
  Url. Slick. And now that we have our API running in production via Heroku let's jump over to our UI project
  and update it so that it will hit our Heroku hosted API.</p>
<p>To do that let's open up baseUrl.js. Note tha right now we are either using the mock api which is hosted
  at 3001 or we were assuming that we were hosting express locally for production. Now instead we have a new
  Url to use for production. So I'll just paste in the Heroku Url that I was assigned in the previous step:</p>
<pre>
<code class="javascript">
return getQueryStringParameterByName('useMockApi') ? 'http://localhost:3001/' :
  'https://mysterious-dawn-16770.herokuapp.com/';
</code>
    </pre>
<p>And make sure that you include the trailing slash on the end. And now we can also open up distServer.js and
  we can remove this section:</p>
<img src="app/javascript/images/buildingajavascriptdevelopmentenvironment/node.png"/>
<p>Because we're going to be hitting Heroku instead of local when we do our production build. This way our
  production build is more realistic. We know that our production api will be hosted on Heroku and we're
  going to host our UI on a separate service here in a moment. But now when we do a production build of our
  UI it will hit our production API hosted on Heroku. In the next clip let's setup an automated deployment
  for the user interface so that we can see all this work together.</p>

<h2>Demo: Automated UI Deploy via Surge</h2>
<p>Ok, now it's time to code our automated UI deployment. Here's our goal for the process that we're going to
  setup for the front end. It's a three step process to get code into production. First we run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm start</code></pre>
<p>to do our development. Once we're done coding we type:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm run build</code></pre>
<p>to build the application in production mode. This opens the application's production build on our local machine
  so we can verify that everything looks good. If we're happy then it's time to deploy to production so we can
  type:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm run deploy</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically push the final built application up to our production host. Of course we already
  setup steps one and two in the previous modules so now it's time to focus on this final step. Alright it's time
  for our final coding session in this course but this one is critical - it takes our front end public. To do
  so we'll host our static front end on sure. Let's make it happen.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of surge because it's a low friction front end and for all the reasons I mentioned earlier
  I strive to build static front ends. Getting started with Surge couldn't be easier. Typically you'd install it
  globally using npm. But we don't need to because we already installed it at the beginning of the course since
  it's listed in our package.json right down here. And we also don't need to install it globally since we're going
  to run it via an npm script. Remember node's bin folder is added to the path automatically for npm scripts. So
  to setup surge I'm going to add one whopping line of code here in package.json:</p>
<pre><code class="json">"deploy": "surge ./dist"</code></pre>
<p>Yes, it's seriously that easy. And that's why I love Surge. Now first of course we need to call:</p>
<pre><code class="json">npm run build -s</code></pre>
<p>So that we have something to push out to production. And when our app starts up in production mode we can
  see the data coming back as expected. If we come in and inspect the network we should see, when we refresh, that
  we're making a call to Heroku as expected. And with this setup we can now hit Ctrl+C and type:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">npm run deploy</code></pre>
<p>We can see surge get's called. It assigns a random domain and when we hit enter it says success. And now
  we know our app is up in production at this random url. So if I open a new tab and load it - there you go.
  We can see our app loading in production and using the Heroku api for the data. Success. Of course the delete link
  wont work since we never added that functionality to our api but if you want a challenge you could certainly
  add a database behind the scenes to support adds and deletes. If we open the browser tools and go to the network
  tab we can see that Surge serves our assets using GZip by default. And of course you'll likely want to setup
  a custom domain and Surge will let you use your own domain for free. Or if you just want to request a subdomain
  you can specify it via a command line flag. There are quite a few nice tweaks that you can make but you get the
  idea. We should strive to build static front end's and if you do Surge is awesome. Of course, your starter kit
  is likely to change over time so in the next clip let's talk about how to keep existing projects updated as our
  starter kit changes.</p>
<h2>Starter Kit Update Approaches</h2>
<p>Now once youv'e created your teams starter kit how do you keep existing projects updated over time as you
  enhance your development environment down the road. Let's review a few approaches. Let me first run through
  a common scenario to help clarify the problem that we're discussing. Imagine that your team watches this
  course and creates a development environment that works great. In the first quarter you launch your first project
  using your new starter kit. Then, in the second quarter, you launch another project successfully using the same
  starter kit. In quarter three, you learn some lessons, upgrade some libraries and tweak your starter kit with
  various enhancements and bug fixes. The question is, how do you easily get these enhancements into the products
  that you launched earlier this year. Of course, one way is to simply manually update these previous projects
  by hand. And that works but we're developers so let's talk about some more automated approaches.</p>
<p>Here are three more automated ways to handle updates to starter kits over time: Yeoman, Github and npm. In the
  next few clips let's discuss each of these options in more detail.</p>
<h2>Option 1: Yeoman</h2>
<p>Yeoman is a handy scaffolding tool for starting new projects so once your happy with your development
  environment you can create a Yeoman generator. This makes it easy for people to create new projects by typing
  yo and then the name of your generator. Yeoman hosts a long list of generators that will give you a head start on
  some of what we've covered in this course. Few will cover all of the features that we just implemented but it's
  another great place to check for inspiration or as a good starting point for your framework or library.</p>
<p>Assuming that you've created a Yeoman generator for your development environment it's a three step process
  to update an existing project later. First, be sure that you've committed all your code to your source control
  system, then re-run the generator on your existing project. Yeoman will prompt you for each file that's being
  overwritten. Then you can diff the files and manually resolve any conflicts that occur. Of course there's much
  more to learn about Yeoman so if you want to know more check out the Yeoman fundamentals course by Steve
  Michelotti.</p>
<h2>Option 2: Github</h2>
<p>Another approach for updating projects is to use Github. With this process you begin by hosting your project
  , of course, on Github and then you fork the starter kit when you start any new projects. This way you can
  pull changes from master as the starter kit is enhanced over time. </p>
<h2>Option 3: npm</h2>
<p>Another approach is to wrap your starter kit in an npm package. With this approach you abstract away the
  configuration and build scripts behind and npm package and then you update the npm package to receive the
  latest changes. This approach has the advantage of abstracting complexity away and it's also the simplest
  to update since you don't need to resolve conflicts like the other two approaches. However, this advantage
  also has an obvious downside. Your restricted from tweaking anything inside the npm package for a given project.
  So this approach is great if you want to programmatically enforce that all projects use the exact same config
  but some may find this approach overly restrictive. Let's talk about this approach in a little more detail
  because it's becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Depending on the complexity of your starter kit updating an existing project manually isn't much work so you
  might consider this hybrid approach. Let's walk through the files that are in our demo's starter kit. The
  most significant piece is in buildScripts. This is the easiest thing to centralize. You can move all of
  buildScripts to an npm package. The other big piece is package.json. There are two sources of complexity here:
  the scripts and the dependencies. For the scripts you can streamline your npm scripts to just call
  buildScripts instead. Since you can put all your build scripts in an npm package this means that your scripts
  and package.json are nothing but a list of function calls to your separate scripts. This effectively
  centralizes your build scripts allowing for bug fixes and tweaks in the future. Webpack's config is just a
  chunk of JSON so it need not be stored in a webpack config file. Instead you can move it into a build scripts
  npm package as well so that it's centralized. The ESLint configuration can be centralized by creating your
  own preset. This way each project can define it's own .eslintrc but use the preset that's stored in npm
  as the baseline. So this covers most of the moving parts in our starter kit. So what's left?
</p>
<p>Well the approaches I outlined on the previous slide centralized all the items on the left using npm.
  That's a significant win since it's the vast majority of the starter kit's code. So what files would we still
  have to update manually? </p>
<ul>
  <li>.editorconfig which is unlikely to change much over time</li>
  <li>.babelrc which contains very little code</li>
  <li>CI config (.travis.yml Appveyor.yml) which is also unlikely to change over time.</li>
  <li>Package references in package.json. These are easy to update with existing npm tooling so again not
    necessarily that big of a deal</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a fan of this hybrid approach. It provides most of the benefits of centralization without the cost of
  creating and maintaining a Yeoman generator. And it gives us a lot of flexibility as well since we can decide
  what's worth centralizing and what isn't. So that's three different ways to keep your projects updated over
  time. Let's close out the course by discussing some sources for inspiration as you move forward on creating your
  own starter kit. </p>
<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>In this course, you saw a massive list of choices and I shared my recommendations but there are litterally
  dozens of other ways to build a JavaScript development environment. So let me share some sources for further
  inspiration.</p>
<p>If you work in React check out Andrew Farmer's excellent list of React boilerplates and starter kits.
  Andrew has catalogued over a hundred starter kits into a curated filterable list. My starter kit: React Slingshot
  is just one of many in this list and I walk through how to build it in module 2 of my React and Redux in ES6
  course. If you work in Angular check out the awesome AngularJS list. AngularJS developers often call their starter
  kits seed projects so check out the full list at this address.</p>
<p>Of course there are many more popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries out there so if your looking for
  inspiration just type the name of your favourite JavaScript framework into Google along with one of these
  terms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Devedlopment environment</li>
  <li>Boilerplate</li>
  <li>Starter kit</li>
  <li>Starter project</li>
  <li>Seed</li>
</ul>
<p>The point is I've just shown you one way of getting this done. So start searching. Let's wrap up the course
  now with my final challenge.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>I like to end my courses with a relevant challenge and this one is no different. My challenge to you is easy.
  Just send a meeting invitation to your team. Why? Because the first step in this process is to start a
  conversation. In this meeting you need to answer some questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Would you benefit from a starter kit? If you expect to start any new projects using he same technology
    stack in the near future then it's worth discussing creating a starter kit.</li>
  <li>What pain points do we have in JavaScript today? Are we struggling with testing, broken builds, time
    consuming manual or faulty deployments, inconsistent coding styles. We just discussed a long list of options
    for solving all of these pain points.</li>
  <li>Would we benefit from a demo application? Are people that join our team clear about how we operate. Do they
    understand our opinions on directory structures, file naming, api calls and more. A demo app clearly
    conveys many of these decisions. These questions should help provide your team with a clear vision on how to
    move forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, hey, this is a pretty easy challenge. Just send an email and get the meeting scheduled.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>And that's a wrap. In this final module we started by discussing why the UI and the API can be useful
  including the ability to deploy the UI and the API alone, separation of concerns (which allows separate teams
  to manage each of these), the ability to select cheap hosts that handle static assets and the flexibility to
  select whatever API technology that you like.</p>
<p>We reviewed a list of potential cloud hosting providers but ultimately created an automated deployment using
  Heroku to host the API and Surge to host the UI. We discussed approaches for keeping your projects updated
  with bug fixes and enhancements as your starter kit improves over time including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yeoman</li>
  <li>Github</li>
  <li>npm</li>
</ul>
<p>And I quickly mentioned a few resources for inspiration including some terms that you can use to help you
  search for starter kits that are specific to your technology stack. And I wrapped up with my very simple
  challenge. Set up a meeting with your team to discuss the path forward. And that's a wrap. Please share
  your links to your starter kit in the course discussion. I'm excited to see what you create. Thank's so much
  for watching.</p>
