                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hi, this is Brian Noyes, and in this module we're going to dive into Data Templates. Data Templates are a very
                    powerful mechanism of WPF data binding that allows you to provide the visual structure for some data-bound
                    object and have that mapped up at runtime as the objects get rendered out. So we'll look at how DataTemplates
                    work and what the variations on DataTemplates are and how to use them.
                </p>
                <p>First we'll talk about the broad concepts of DataTemplates and how they work in general, and how they get
                    mapped out to the data objects that are being rendered out to provide the visual structure for rendering on
                    the screen.
                </p>
                <p>Next we'll talk about ExplicitDataTemplates, which are the most direct and simple way to use DataTemplates. As
                    the name implies, it involves a direct hookup between the data-bound control and the template that should be
                    used for a given collection or data object.
                </p>
                <p>Next we'll talk about ImplicitDataTemplates, which are a little more magical in the way that they work, but it
                    involves an automatic selection of the appropriate DataTemplate based on the type of the data object that's
                    going to be rendered, and this gives us an awful lot of power for handling heterogeneous collections of
                    derived types of some data object type, and it becomes vitally important in Model-View-ViewModel scenarios,
                    which we'll use in the demos to render out different Views for different ViewModel types.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we'll talk about DataTemplateSelectors, which give you a little more explicit control, but still dynamic
                    control to switch which DataTemplate you use based on whatever logic you need to invoke to make that
                    selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, we'll finish off this module with HierarchicalDataTemplates, which are just a specialized form of
                    DataTemplate that work in hierarchical data model scenarios such as presenting data in TreeView control.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>DataTemplates Overview</h3>
                <p>The way DataTemplates work, in general, is that you are going to have some data-bound control:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-001.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And it's either going to be a ContentControl or some control derived from ItemsControl in general, such as
                    ListBox, ComboBox or DataGrid.
                </p>
                <p>Let's start with the ContentControl case. ContentControl, if you're not familiar, has a single Content property
                    that can be set to a UI element and it will render that UI element in the child area, so the child area is
                    really a blank canvas in which the content can be rendered.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-002.png" class="image"/>
                <p>In this case, though, we're supplying the content as a data-bound object. It happens to be a ViewModel in this
                    case, and this is where DataTemplates come in, is that a DataTemplate can provide the visual structure for how
                    to render that data object into that child content area.
                </p>
                <p>So we then supply a DataTemplate, and the DataTemplate has some structure to it. In this case we've just got a
                    child user control as the structure of that DataTemplate as the nested element:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-003.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And when these come together in the data binding context, that DataTemplate provides the visual structure for
                    the data-bound object that is the content.
                </p>
                <p>Now a really important part of DataTemplates to understand is that when a DataTemplate gets rendered, the
                    DataContext property of the root element in that DataTemplate, in this case, the HierarchalDataTemplates view,
                    it's DataContext will be set to the instance of the data-bound object that is being rendered:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-004.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So in this case, the CurrentViewModel object will be set as the DataContext for that
                    HierarchalDataTemplatesView.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-005.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now in the case of an ItemsControl, such as a ListBox, ComboBox or DataGrid, first off you're going to be
                    binding to a collection of data objects and the idea is you want to have a visual representation for each one
                    of those collection objects, so you provide a DataTemplate and hook it in either implicitly or explicitly, as
                    we'll cover in this module, and that DataTemplate provides that visual structure for how do I render a single
                    Product object in this case:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-006.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So here we have a grid with an image and a couple of rows in it to provide the name and description for that
                    product.
                </p>
                <p>So that DataTemplate basically lays down what is the visual structure for that data object:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-007.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Within the DataTemplate we have individual bindings and you can see that they're just binding with simple paths
                    to properties on a single Product object.
                </p>
                <p>This works because, again, whenever a DataTemplate is rendered, the DataContext of the root element is set to
                    the data object it's being rendered for, in this case, a Product object. So that DataContext flows down the
                    visual tree of this DataTemplate, making that DataContext available to those child bindings.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-008.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And then in the case of an ItemsControl, this all comes together in that the ListBox, in this case, will render
                    out a single instance of that DataTemplate for each product object in the collection it's bound to, setting
                    the DataContext of that single instance to that product object:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-009.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And that's basically how DataTemplates work at a high level. So now let's look at the different ways to get
                    them hooked up and the different variants of DataTemplates.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Explicit DataTemplates</h3>
                <p>So first let's look at ExplicitDataTemplates because they're the most straightforward in terms of the way the
                    DataTemplate gets hooked up to the data-bound control.
                </p>
                <p>First off, you're going to define a DataTemplate somewhere, and usually that's going to be in a Resource
                    dictionary, and again, you define that DataTemplate with some visual structure for some data object that you
                    want to render out:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-010.png" class="image"/>
                <p>You're going to give that DataTemplate a key if it lives in the Resource dictionary, so that you can then refer
                    to it by pointing to it with a StaticResource or DynamicResource markup extension from the appropriate
                    property of the data-bound control.
                </p>
                <p>The property we're talking about here is either going to be the ContentTemplate property of a ContentControl or
                    the ItemTemplate of an ItemsControl, such as a ListBox. That tells that control to use that specific
                    DataTemplate when it's rendering out the data-bound objects that it's pointed to.
                </p>
                <p>Then at runtime it's going to be used to render out those data-bound objects and provide the visual
                    representation of those objects, and again, the DataTemplate can contain bindings to the properties of that
                    data-bound object. So let's take a look at a demo of using ExplicitDataTemplates to render out some data.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I want to show you how you can use ExplicitDataTemplates to provide the visual structure for a
                    data-bound object that's being rendered in a control.
                </p>
                <p>Our starting point for this demo, and the rest of the demos in this module is this DataTemplates project, which
                    is just a stock WPF project with a couple things added at this point. We've got this Images subfolder that has
                    some product images that we'll use for rendering purposes:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-011.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And we've got a RelayCommand, which we've seen in previous modules for hooking up Command scenarios. We've also
                    got our ZzaData data layer that brings in data via Entity Framework from a Zza database.
                </p>
                <p>Now in this demo, I'm going to go ahead and use the Model-View-ViewModel, or MVVM pattern, in a very simplistic
                    form. You don't have to get too wrapped up in that, I'm using it as just another example of data binding and
                    also because in MVVM DataTemplates become fairly important.
                </p>
                <p>So the first thing I'm going to do is add a View in ViewModel. The View will be called
                    ExplicitDataTemplatesView and it will be a User Control.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-012.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And then I'll add a class called ExplicitDataTemplatesViewModel. I'm going to replace this class with a
                    fleshed-out definition and just explain the code here quickly.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-013.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Okay, so the fleshed out definition here is a class that implements INotifyPropertyChanged, so that it can
                    participate nicely in data binding.
                </p>
                <p>It exposes one property called Products, which is an observable collection of products suitable for data
                    binding, again:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-014.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And then it has a Constructor that only when you're not in the DesignTime environment, and you can do that by
                    checking this Designer properties GetIsInDesignMode property.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-015.png" class="image"/>
                <p>If it's true, then you're in the designer, if it's false you're not. So only if we're not in the Designer, do
                    we go out to the database and populate our products by going to the Products collection of our Zza DBContext.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-016.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And then we're looping over each product after we get it, and modifying the Image property to have this
                    relative path down into the Images folder that's part of our project.
                </p>
                <p>Now we need a View that's going to data bind to this, and whenever you do the MVVM pattern, the ViewModel is
                    going to be set as the DataContext for the View. So the View elements can just bind to the exposed properties
                    of that ViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>So let's go into our View and add a local namespace so that we can get to the other objects defined in our
                    project
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-017.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and then we're going to set the DataContext of this View declaratively by setting the DataContext property to
                    an instance of our new ViewModel
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-018.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we can add elements to this View that bind to the exposed properties of that ViewModel.</p>
                <p>So I'm going to add a ListBox that's bound to our Products collection. So I'll drop down here in the Grid and
                    add that ListBox, and we can see we just set Binding to Products:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-019.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and because there is a Products property that exposes a collection on our ViewModel, we should be good to go
                    here. Now to actually see this View, we're going to have to put it into our MainWindow. So I'm going to drop
                    over to my MainWindow, build to make sure that Visual Studio knows about those, and open up my Toolbox. And up
                    here at the top you can see that our ExplicitDataTemplateView shows up:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-020.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I can drag and drop that into the Grid of the MainWindow. If I go ahead and run at this point, we can see that
                    I do, in fact, get products rendered out:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-021.png" class="image"/>
                <p>but I'm just getting a ToString on the Product object, not very functional. So the simplest thing we could do
                    is drop here to our ListBox and add the DisplayMemberPath property pointing to the Name property of each of
                    the products.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-022.png" class="image"/>
                <p>If we run with that we get a slightly more functional ListBox where we see the product name, but it's not very
                    pretty to look at. This is WPF and we can put a little more visual flare on presenting a product, and that's
                    where DataTemplates come in.
                </p>
                <p>Now normally when you define DataTemplates, you're going to want to make them reusable. That means you're going
                    to put them into a Resource dictionary. So I'm going to go into the UserControl.Resources here and declare
                    myself a DataTemplate called ProductTemplate:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-023.png" class="image"/>
                <p>A DataTemplate is just an element that you can create inside of a Resource dictionary and it has some content
                    to it. The content of the DataTemplate is the visual structure that's going to be rendered out when that
                    DataTemplate is used. So we want some visual structure to render out a product here.
                </p>
                <p>I'm going to drop into my DataTemplate and add some XAML:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-024.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And we can see what I've added here is a root Grid that has two columns. In the first column is an Image
                    control that's going to render out our Image property of an individual product. Then there's a nested Grid
                    that has two rows. The first row is going to show the name of the product and the second row is going to show
                    the description of the product. Notice that each of these bindings is assuming that the DataContext is going
                    to be set to an individual product, and that's an important part of how DataTemplates work.
                </p>
                <p>An instance of this DataTemplate and its contents is going to be rendered out for each data-bound object in a
                    bound context. So in the case of a ListBox, we're going to have a collection of products. For each product in
                    that collection, it's going to render out an instance of the contents of this DataTemplate.
                </p>
                <p>And as part of that process, conceptually, it is setting the DataContext property to that Product object that
                    is being rendered:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-025.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now you don't explicitly put that there, that's going to happen automatically for you when the DataTemplate is
                    rendered, but the root elements DataContext is going to be set to the data- bound object, and that means that
                    DataContext will flow down and nested bindings within that template can just use a Path property off of that
                    DataContext object.
                </p>
                <p>Now that we have our template defined, we need to tie it into our ListBox, so we're going to get rid of the
                    DisplayMemberPath and instead use a property called ItemTemplate.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-026.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We're going to point to our template through a StaticResource to the ProductTemplate.</p>
                <p>And with that in place, we can go ahead and run:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-027.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and now we see a much more visually-appealing presentation of our products in the ListBox.</p>
                <p>And we can put whatever structure we want into this DataTemplate to render out the data that is associated with
                    whatever visual elements we want to present them.
                </p>
                <p>Now we could make some further modifications to our DataTemplate. If I go to this nested grid and set a Height
                    property, I can actually use other forms of bindings that we've talked about with ElementName and
                    RelativeSource bindings, for example, to point to other elements within our DataTemplate:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-028.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So, in this case, you can see that we gave a name to our Image called ProductImage and we can use an
                    ElementName binding to point to that and modify the height of our Grid based on the height of that image, and
                    really this should say ActualHeight.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-029.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Whenever you bind to a height or width, make sure you're binding to the ActualHeight or ActualWidth.</p>
                <p>Likewise, I could add a couple more row definitions to this nested grid, and then drop down and add a couple
                    more TextBlocks:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-030.png" class="image"/>
                <p>In this case, one of these is using a RelativeSource binding and you can see it's going to walk all the way up
                    using the AncestorType to get to the ListBox that this is going to be rendered in.
                </p>
                <p>Even though this DataTemplate itself does not explicitly know about the ListBox, this stuff all comes together
                    at runtime into the visual tree. So an ancestor of this TextBlock element will be somewhere up the chain, will
                    be the ListBox itself.
                </p>
                <p>So we can walk all the way up there, use the ListBox as our source object, and then we could us a path that
                    dots down to the ItemsSource, which will be our Products collection, and the Count on that collection, and
                    render that out in a TextBox.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-031.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Likewise, we can even use ElementName bindings that are outside of our CurrentDataTemplate. So the name of our
                    ListBox is ProductsListBox:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-032.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That's out here in the main visual tree</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-033.png" class="image"/>
                <p>but at runtime, this TextBlock will be rendered as part of the overall UI so it's able to use an ElementName
                    binding to locate another element within that same UI, and in this case we're going to do the same thing, dot
                    down through the ItemsSource to the Count.
                </p>
                <p>With those in place, if I run right now, it's actually not going to render right because of this ActualHeight.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-034.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I wanted to show that as an example, but it'll end up truncating those fields that we just added because the
                    image won't be big enough. So I'm just going to take this Height off of here and run. And now we can see the
                    two 41's there:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-035.png" class="image"/>
                <p>41 products in our collection, getting 1 by walking up the element tree to the ListBox, and getting the
                    Products collection off of the ItemsSource there, the other one using the ElementName binding to get to the
                    ListBox and gets the Products collection from there.
                </p>
                <p>Now one last thing to show is I'm going to cut this DataTemplate out of the Resource dictionary:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-036.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and show you that you can define it nested directly on the element itself.</p>
                <p>So if I go onto my ListBox and set the ItemTemplate property as a nested element here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-037.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and I paste that DataTemplate in there and get rid of the key because it's no longer in the Resource
                    dictionary:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-038.png" class="image"/>
                <p>now the structure here is similar to what we did with our DataContext being set to an instance of a ViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>Here we're really just setting the ItemTemplate property of the ListBox explicitly to an instance of a
                    DataTemplate. That works exactly the same:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-039.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We can see the same visual rendering of our elements. The difference here is this DataTemplate:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-040.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Is no longer reusable, it's only available within the context of this ListBox. So generally, I'll stick to
                    defining my DataTemplate as part of a Resource dictionary, giving it a key, and then referring to that from
                    the ItemTemplate property with a StaticResource.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-041.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Then you could potentially move that DataTemplate out from the User Control to an application-scoped resource
                    or even in the reusable class library and use it over and over again in multiple places in your applications.
                </p>
                <p>So that's how you use ExplicitDataTemplates. Specifically point to one through the ItemTemplate property of a
                    ListBox or we'll see another example is a ContentTemplate property of a ContentControl.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Implicit DataTemplates</h3>
                <p>Now let's talk about ImplicitDataTemplates. ImplicitDataTemplates give you a lot more power and flexibility to
                    address scenarios where you may not have a one-to-one mapping between a given DataObject type and the control
                    where a specific DataTemplate is supposed to be used for that object type.
                </p>
                <p>Basically, an ImplicitDataTemplate gets associated automatically with a data-bound object based on the type of
                    that object when it's being rendered. For ImplicitDataTemplates to work, the DataTemplate has to be defined in
                    the Resource dictionary that is in-scope wherever that data-bound control is going to be.
                </p>
                <p>So down below you can see we have a ContentControl that's binding to a CurrentViewModel:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-042.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And we placed the DataTemplate in a Resource dictionary that is somewhere upstream of that.</p>
                <p>It could be a Resource dictionary directly on the ContentControl, on the containing Grid, on the containing
                    window or out at application scope, as long as it is at the same scope or a higher scope, in terms of
                    resources, from the control that's going to be data binding and looking for a DataTemplate.
                </p>
                <p>Next we have to have a DataType property on our DataTemplate that matches up to the concrete type of the
                    data-bound object in that data binding context. So our content down below is binding to a CurrentViewModel
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-043.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That CurrentViewModel can be one of several types and, in this case, it's checking the Type of that object and
                    if it matches up to be an ExplicitDataTemplatesViewModel, then this is the appropriate DataTemplate for it,
                    and it will automatically select that and use it to render it out.
                </p>
                <p>Note the use of the x:Type markup extension, make sure you use that. It's very tempting to just put the Type
                    name itself in quotes there, and then the DataTemplate won't work as expected. And basically,
                    ImplicitDataTemplates give you a lot of flexibility now, because the object that shows up through a binding,
                    such as this CurrentViewModel can dynamically change over time, between different Types and then the
                    DataTemplate can select the appropriate visual representation based on that Type.
                </p>
                <p>So it could either be pushing a different ViewModel into this Content property as shown in this example, or it
                    could be something like a ListBox with a collection of different types of objects in the collection based on
                    some common base Type, such as Product, where each derived type has its own specific DataTemplate mapped to
                    it. So let's take a look at a demo of using ImplicitDataTemplates to facilitate View switching in a ViewModel
                    scenario.

                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I'm going to show you how to use ImplicitDataTemplates to automatically associate a DataTemplate
                    with a data-bound object based on its type. Starting point for this demo is the ending point from the last one
                    where we showed ExplicitDataTemplates.
                </p>
                <p>Let's get started here. I'm going to add a new View in ViewModel. I'm going to call the View
                    DataTemplateSelectorsView because we're going to use it in the subsequent demo for that purpose:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-044.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And then I'll add a class that's called DataTemplateSelectorsViewModel.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-045.png" class="image"/>
                <p>In the view, I'm going to add a single element, which is a TextBlock that just says DataTemplateSelectorsView
                    so we know when that view is presented.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-046.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Basically what we're going to be setting up here is the ability to switch between child views, between our
                    ExplicitDataTemplateView and our DataTemplateSelectorsView, and do that using ImplicitDataTemplates. So I'm
                    going to go back to my ExplicitDataTemplateView and get rid of the explicit setting of the DataContext here:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-047.png" class="image"/>
                <p>because this is going to end up being done now automatically through ImplicitDataTemplates.</p>
                <p>Now we're going to need some logic to switch between the ExplicitDataTemplateView and the
                    DataTemplateSelectorsView, and we're going to put that logic in a ViewModel for the MainWindow. So I'm going
                    to add a new ViewModel called MainWindowViewModel.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-048.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And we're going to first make this a proper ViewModel by implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-049.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and then we're going to statically wire this up to our MainWindow by setting the DataContext in the MainWindow,
                    similar to what we saw in a previous demo.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-050.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I'm going to get rid of this explicit instance of our ExplicitDataTemplatesView:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-051.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And what we're going to do is drop back into our ViewModel and declare a property called CurrentViewModel:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-052.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So the idea is that we can set an instance of a ViewModel into this property and data bind to it from the
                    MainWindow, and that will cause the current rendered child view to switch out.
                </p>
                <p>So now we need some ViewModels to switch between. I'm going to pop in here two more MemberVariables, one an
                    instance of our ExplicitDataTemplatesViewModel and one an instance of our DataTemplateSelectorsViewModel.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-053.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we need some logic that's actually going to switch between those two and we're going to do that with
                    Commands.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-054.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So I've added two RelayCommands to my MainWindowViewModel, View1Command and View2Command, that can be triggered
                    from the MainWindow. You can see the handling is simply to set the CurrentViewModel to the respective
                    ViewModel.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-055.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That will trigger a PropertyChanged:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-056.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and now we can set up some data binding in the view to cause the right view to be rendered for that ViewModel
                    using ImplicitDataTemplates. So we're going to go up here to our MainWindow and replace our main Grid with a
                    grid that has two rows in it.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-057.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The first row has a StackPanel with two Buttons. Each Button is wired up to its respective Command,
                    view1Command and View2Command, on the current DataContext, which is our MainWindowViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>Then in the second row we just have a ContentControl:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-058.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The ContentControl in WPF is a nice little container control that you set the content to some UI element and
                    that UI element will be rendered out in the child area of that control. Now you can set the Content property
                    explicitly to a UI element, or you can set the Content property to a data-bound object and use DataTemplates
                    to render out that object.
                </p>
                <p>So here you can see I'm setting the Content property to our CurrentViewModel property back in our
                    MainWindowViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>Now as we saw in previous demos, if we did nothing else it would just do a ToString on whatever that ViewModel
                    is and it wouldn't look the way we want it, so what we want to do is supply a DataTemplate that's going to be
                    automatically married up with the appropriate ViewModel Type to render out a corresponding view for that
                    ViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>So what I can do is go up here in my Window and add a Resources section.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-059.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And in that Resource section I define two DataTemplates, one that is mapped through the DataType property to
                    the ExplicitDataTemplateViewModel Type. Notice the x:Type markup extension here, it's very easy to forget
                    this, and if so, your DataTemplates won't work correctly.
                </p>
                <p>But anytime you set the DataType property, notice we don't have to set a key even though we're in a Resource
                    dictionary, because the key will implicitly be the DataType. But what's going to happen here is that anything
                    that's data-bound where this Resource is in scope, specifically our ContentControl:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-060.png" class="image"/>
                <p>that's binding content to one or the other of those ViewModel Types. The data binding is actually going to look
                    out into all the Resources that are currently in scope, see if there is a DataTemplate mapped to the type of
                    the object that's currently being rendered, and if so, it will render out whatever the contents of that
                    DataTemplate are.
                </p>
                <p>The contents of this DataTemplate is nothing more than our User Control that represents our view in the MVVM
                    pattern. And remember that I said in a previous demo that whenever a DataTemplate is rendered out, whatever
                    the root element of that DataTemplate is will have its DataContext set to the DataObject for which it's being
                    rendered.
                </p>
                <p>So basically, the view's DataContext will be set to the instance of the ViewModel that it's being rendered out
                    for. So we have one map to one ViewModel Type, one map to another ViewModel Type, and again, we're switching
                    which ViewModel is being set in the Command handling of our MainWindowViewModel:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-061.png" class="image"/>
                <p>With that code in place, I can go ahead and run, and now we can see the two buttons up at the top, I can click
                    on the DataTemplateSelectorsView, we switch to that one.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-062.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I can click on the ExplicitDataTemplatesView and we switch to that one.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-063.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And again, the chain of events there are, we're clicking on the button that fires the Command:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-064.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The Command is wired up to set one or the other ViewModel as the CurrentViewModel:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-065.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That triggers a PropertyChange on the CurrentViewModel:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-066.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which is bound to the Content property.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-067.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now that a new DataObject has shown up in the Content property through a binding, Control goes out and looks in
                    the available Resources, finds the corresponding DataTemplate mapped to that DataType:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-068.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And renders out the corresponding view for it, setting the DataContext of that root element of the DataTemplate
                    to whatever the DataObject is it's mapped to. And that's how you can use ImplicitDataTemplates to render out
                    views and ViewModels.
                </p>
                <p>ImplicitDataTemplates can also certainly be used for heterogeneous collections. Say that you had a bunch of
                    subtypes of product that you were going to render out in a ListBox and you wanted to have a different
                    DataTemplate for each subtype of a product. You could use the DataType to map to those concrete types of the
                    derived types, and then you could have a ListBox bound to a collection of products. And then as it looped
                    through, rendering out each product, it would find the corresponding DataTemplate based on the DataType for
                    the concrete type of product that you're dealing with, and would render out that template.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>DataTemplateSelectors</h3>
                <p>Sometimes when you want to use DataTemplates, things may be a little more dynamic and you may need to
                    dynamically select the appropriate DataTemplate based on some criteria that goes beyond just the type of the
                    data-bound object.
                </p>
                <p>As we just covered, if the criteria is just simply based on the type of the data-bound object, you could use
                    ImplicitDataTemplates, but you might need to select based on some property value on the data-bound object
                    itself, or other logic within the application, and that's where DataTemplateSelectors come in.
                </p>
                <p>DataTemplateSelectors at a high level let you dynamically select the right DataTemplate based on whatever logic
                    you need to derive that, and the most common example would be to inspect some property value on the data-bound
                    object and select the appropriate template based on that.
                </p>
                <p>So what you do is you derive a class from a base class called DataTemplateSelector in the framework. In that
                    class, you override a SelectTemplate method so the simplest possible implementation would look something like
                    this:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-069.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We derive our class from DataTemplateSelector, we override the SelectTemplate method.</p>
                <p>That takes in two parameters. The first one is going to be passed the data-bound object that you're supposed to
                    come up with a DataTemplate for. The second parameter is the element on which the binding is that this
                    DataTemplateSelector is being used from, and you can use either of those criteria and possibly other logic in
                    your application, such as who the user is, what time of day it is, and other criteria such as that, to
                    determine what template to return.
                </p>
                <p>Ultimately, you invoke some logic and you come up with a DataTemplate. That logic could dynamically build that
                    DataTemplate in memory, but most often you're going to go out and locate it inside of a Resource dictionary so
                    that those can be declared in the DesignTime environment as XAML.
                </p>
                <p>So basically, you use whatever logic is needed and come up with a DataTemplate and return it. And then finally,
                    you need to hook it up, so you're going to set the ItemTemplateSelector or ContentTemplateSelector property on
                    your data-bound control depending on whether it's an ItemsControl or a ContentControl.
                </p>
                <p>So let's take a look at a demo of using DataTemplateSelectors to dynamically select the appropriate
                    DataTemplate.

                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I'm going to show you how to use DataTemplateSelectors to dynamically select an appropriate
                    DataTemplate based on some property of the data-bound objects. To do this, I'm first going to need to define a
                    DataTemplateSelector, which is nothing more than a class.
                </p>
                <p>So I'm going to add a class here called ProductTemplateSelector.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-070.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I'm going to flesh it out here by inheriting from the DataTemplateSelector class and overriding the
                    SelectTemplate method on that base class, which you can see returns a DataTemplate:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-071.png" class="image"/>
                <p>It takes in two arguments, the first of which is the data-bound object that's being rendered through a binding.
                    The second is the element on which the binding is attached to. From there, your logic can figure out however
                    it needs to, how to come up with a DataTemplate.
                </p>
                <p>Now the implementation I'm showing here is a simple reusable version where I know that I'm going to be using
                    this for Products, so I can go ahead and cast the data-bound object to a Product object.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-072.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Likewise, I can cast the container to a framework element.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-073.png" class="image"/>
                <p>As long as both of those casts succeeded, this TemplateSelector must be hooked up in the place I expect it to
                    be. If not, I can just punt here and return null.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-074.png" class="image"/>
                <p>But as long as I got that far, then I can go and invoke some logic to figure out what DataTemplate to use based
                    on the product that I'm seeing. Now the simple logic I have wired up here is that a product has a Type
                    property on it:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-075.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and that Type is going to be pizza, salad or drink in our Zza data examples.</p>
                <p>If I just concatenate Template onto the end of that and assume that out in the current Resource dictionary for
                    the element that this binding is on, there is a DataTemplate named that template, then I can locate it with a
                    FindResource and just return that.
                </p>
                <p>Now obviously, you could have whatever convoluted logic you want here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-076.png" class="image"/>
                <p>you could new up a DataTemplate from scratch and dynamically populate its elements from programmatic code.
                    Generally you're going to want to declare these in XAML and locate them as a Resource, as I'm doing here,
                    through some kind of naming convention. Now we need to go ahead and hook this up to our data-bound context.
                </p>
                <p>So what I'm going to do is go out to a View I created in a previous demo called DataTemplateSelectorsView, and
                    I'm going to add in a Resources section that creates an instance of my ProductTemplateSelector, and I'll need
                    a local namespace up above.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-077.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now that I have an instance of that Selector available, I can use it in the data-bound Context. So I'm going to
                    replace my TextBox down here with a ListBox. We'll bind the ItemsSource of that ListBox to Products and we'll
                    set a property called ItemTemplateSelector, pointing through a StaticResource to the instance of our
                    ProductTemplateSelector.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-078.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we just need to get these products from somewhere, so I'm going to wire that up in the ViewModel for this
                    View. So if I go to the DataTemplateSelectorsViewModel and replace that class with something similar to what
                    we've seen before:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-079.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We have a Products collection exposed. We only populate that Products collection from the database if we're not
                    in Design mode and it raises PropertyChanged events when it gets set.
                </p>
                <p>So now how is that ViewModel getting hooked up to our view? Well, if you remember from the
                    ImplicitDataTemplates demo, it's being automatically associated through the DataTemplates out in the
                    MainWindow.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-080.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So remember we had this DataTemplateSelectorViewModel ImplicitDataTemplate rendering out the
                    DataTemplateSelectorsView, which will set its DataContext to the instance of the ViewModel
                </p>
                <p>So the only thing we have left to do is define the DataTemplates that are going to be rendered out by our
                    ProductTemplateSelector. So if we add into our Resources section here, three DataTemplates:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-081.png" class="image"/>
                <p>One called pizzaTemplate, one called saladTemplate, and one called drinkTemplate, the Type property on the
                    product is going to be salad, drink or pizza, and we concatenate that template name onto it inside of our
                    ProductTemplateSelector. Each of these:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-082.png" class="image"/>
                <p>is just going to render out a simple representation of a pizza, salad or drink. So by setting that
                    ItemTemplateSelector, it will invoke our DataTemplateSelector, and we can run, go to the
                    DataTemplateSelectorsView, and there you can see the pizzas look like that:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-083.png" class="image"/>
                <p>the salads look like that:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-084.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and the drinks look like that.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-085.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So by defining your own DataTemplateSelector, overriding the SelectTemplate, and invoking whatever logic is
                    needed inside your DataTemplateSelector, you can dynamically return whatever DataTemplate is needed for your
                    scenario.

            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>HierarchicalDataTemplates</h3>
                <p>The last kind of DataTemplate we'll look at here is called a HierarchicalDataTemplate, and it's specifically
                    designed to address hierarchical data models presented in a TreeView control in WPF, but it can also be used
                    with some third party controls that present hierarchical data as well.
                </p>
                <p>The general idea is that similar to a DataTemplate, it contains a chunk of XAML that represents the visual
                    structure of a data object that's going to be rendered as a node within the tree, but it has a number of
                    additional properties to it to capture the fact that there are child collections and child hierarchies that
                    also need to be rendered.
                </p>
                <p>The first of those is the ItemsSource property on the HierarchicalDataTemplate. Basically, this points to a
                    property on the current node object that should be a child collection of objects, and it indicates to the
                    TreeView control that there are more child items to be rendered there.
                </p>
                <p>Then there is the ItemTemplate property on the HierarchicalDataTemplate. This provides a DataTemplate for how
                    do you render those child objects in that child collection.
                </p>
                <p>If you have fairly static structure to the object model, this is all you'll need. If you have a more dynamic
                    scenario, there is an ItemTemplateSelector property so you can use a DataTemplateSelector, as we covered
                    earlier in the module, to dynamically determine which DataTemplate to use given the type or property values on
                    the data-bound child objects.
                </p>
                <p>You can also use ImplicitDataTemplates with HierarchicalDataTemplates, so it has a DataType property just like
                    a normal DataTemplate does, that you can set to a Type and it can automatically map up based on the concrete
                    type of the node that's being rendered which DataTemplate to use. So let's take a look at a demo of using
                    HierarchicalDataTemplates.

                <p>In this demo, I'm going to show you how to work with HierarchicalDataTemplates, which are a special kind of
                    DataTemplate that work with TreeView controls, as well as with other hierarchical data-bound third party
                    vendor components.
                </p>
                <p>The starting point here is where we left off in the last demo where we had our ImplicitDataTemplates allowing
                    us to switch between multiple views, the ExplicitDataTemplatesViewModel and the
                    DataTemplateSelectorsViewModel.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-086.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I've added one more view here that we're going to start fleshing out in this demo called
                    HierarchicalDataTemplateView and ViewModel. And to get those switching, the way we did the other views, I
                    added another ViewModel instance to the MainWindowViewModel:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-087.png" class="image"/>
                <p>another Command to trigger switching to that view:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-088.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and the Command handler that sets that as the CurrentViewModel on the MainWindowViewModel.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-089.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So that should all look familiar from the ImplicitDataTemplates demo. So if I run at this point, I can start up
                    the app. We'll have three buttons now at the top of the screen:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-090.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and I can switch between the DataTemplateSelectorsView, the ExplicitDataTemplatesView, and this new blank
                    HierarchicalDataTemplatesView and its corresponding ViewModel.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-091.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So the first thing we're going to want is some real data to work with, in our ViewModel, so I fleshed out some
                    code here. You can see that our ViewModel implements INotifyPropertyChanged, as usual:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-092.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We have a constructor that is, only when we're not in the Designer, going out to the database through our
                    DBContext and retrieving the Customers collection from our DBContext.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-093.png" class="image"/>
                <p>In this case, however, it's also using the .Include method of Entity Framework to retrieve the related Orders,
                    OrderItems, and the Product for each OrderItem, which sets up a hierarchical data object graph for us to work
                    with in this demo.
                </p>
                <p>The exposed property from our ViewModel is just the root Customers collection:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-094.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and we're going to data bind to that in a TreeView control. So now let's go over to the view for this
                    HierarchicalDataTemplate and let's add a little bit of XAML:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-095.png" class="image"/>
                <p>What I added here in terms of the root structure of the View is a TreeView control. You can see that the
                    ItemsSource is pointing to our Customers collection, which will be on our DataContext that is our ViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>Then we use the ItemTemplate as we did before with the ExplicitDataTemplates demo, to point to a Resource that
                    has a DataTemplate. That DataTemplate is up at the tope, named CustomerTemplate, and it's just got some simple
                    structure, which is a StackPanel with an Image and a TextBlock in it.
                </p>
                <p>If we run our demo at this point, and we switch to the HierarchicalDataTemplatesView:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-096.png" class="image"/>
                <p>you can see that we are getting data rendered out based on our DataTemplate, but notice there's no expander
                    nodes next to these Customer objects, it's really more like a ListBox at this point, and we're not really
                    getting that hierarchical presentation that we want. This is where HierarchicalDataTemplates come in.
                </p>
                <p>So I'm going to change out this normal DataTemplate for a HierarchicalDataTemplate for Customers that goes one
                    level deeper to the Orders.
                </p>
                <p>So now you can see what we have is a HierarchicalDataTemplate:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-097.png" class="image"/>
                <p>It still has the same key as before, so that the ItemTemplate can point to it. It's got the same root level
                    structure of a StackPanel with an Image and a TextBlock next to it, but then it's got two additional things.
                </p>
                <p>The first is the ItemsSource property.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-098.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The ItemsSource property on a HierarchicalDataTemplate points to some property hanging off of the current node
                    object, which will be a customer, in this case, that is a collection itself, a child collection. So in this
                    case, the child collection of orders for a given customer will be on an Orders property of the Customer
                    object. That sets up the notion that there's more to render at a child level, and then the ItemTemplate
                    property of the HierarchicalDataTemplate allows us to supply what is the DataTemplate that is going to be used
                    to render that.
                </p>
                <p>And here, one level down:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-099.png" class="image"/>
                <p>we can see we can just use a normal DataTemplate at that level and we have some simple structure there with
                    another StackPanel with an Image and a TextBlock, in this case, binding against the OrderDate using a
                    StringFormat for a short Date string and we'll have the Image pointing to some stock image there.
                </p>
                <p>With that in place, if we run, we'll get one level of expansion based on that Orders collection, on each
                    customer. So we go to the HierarchicalDataTemplatesView, you can see we have the Expander icon here, and when
                    we expand, we see the orders for Puckett and the orders for Russell, and so on.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-100.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we can take this even deeper and I can replace this HierarchicalDataTemplate with an even bigger one that
                    goes one level deeper. So we still have the root HierarchicalDataTemplate that our ItemTemplate is pointing
                    to.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-101.png" class="image"/>
                <p>It's got the binding to the Orders collection on each customer and the structure for each customer. Then it's
                    got the ItemTemplate for each Order in that Orders collection, which again, has its root structure that's a
                    StackPanel, but then it has its own ItemsSource that says each order has an OrderItems property.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-102.png" class="image"/>
                <p>For each OrderItem, what is the template for that? We go another level down and specify the ItemTemplate for
                    that child HierarchicalDataTemplate and give it some structure:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-103.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And in this case, if this is our leaf node, we can just use a standard DataTemplate. So if we run this, go to
                    the HierarchicalDataTemplatesView, expand down to Orders, and expand down to OrderItems, then we can see we
                    have different icons and different levels for those.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-104.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now the problem with what we've shown so far is, this works if there's a single child collection per level of
                    the hierarchy that you want to drill down into, but what if there's multiple child collections and what if
                    they are composed of heterogeneous derived types from some base type, such as Product as a base type and then
                    specific product-derived types that have their own DataTemplates? Well, the good news is, you can mix
                    HierarchicalDataTemplates with the concept of ImplicitDataTemplates.
                </p>
                <p>So I'm going to replace all of these HierarchicalDataTemplates with a series of three DataTemplates in our
                    Resource collection.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-105.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Notice these are ImplicitDataTemplates using the DataType property to say, if a given data-bound node happens
                    to be a Customer object, then we render it out with this content
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-106.png" class="image"/>
                <p>as our DataTemplate and we can have an ItemSource for that. Now we don't have to specify the ItemTemplate here
                    for those orders, because that can be matched up with a separate ImplicitDataTemplate:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-107.png" class="image"/>
                <p>so here we have another ImplicitDataTemplate that maps to Order objects and it knows how to render out those
                    nodes and what child collection it can bind against on those nodes.
                </p>
                <p>And then finally, down at the leaf node level, for OrderItem, it's got the structure for those</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-108.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So then we just get rid of the ItemTemplate down here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-109.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and go ahead and run, switch to the HierarchicalDataTemplatesView, and now you can see the rendering is
                    simpler.
                </p>
                <p>I don't have images involved in the templates now, but you can see we've got the name of the customer, the
                    Order Date for the order, and the Product name for the OrderItems.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig05-110.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So it's able to match up the right DataTemplate for the right node in the Tree based on the type of the data
                    object being rendered.
                </p>
                <p>And again, this would allow us to have multiple derived types in a heterogeneous collection in those child
                    collections, and each one could render out its respective DataTemplate, similar to what we saw with rendering
                    different Views for different ViewModel Types.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>In this module, we saw how you could use DataTemplates to start to put together a much more complex visual
                    structure for the way you render out individual data-bound objects.
                </p>
                <p>We saw that at a high level, DataTemplates supply that visual structure for the way you're going to render out
                    a given data-bound object in a data binding scenario. And we talked about the fact that the main place this is
                    going to apply is in ContentControls or ItemsControls, which certainly could be nested down inside of
                    something like a cell of a DataGrid.
                </p>
                <p>First we dove into ExplicitDataTemplates where you saw you define a DataTemplate, you give it a name, and you
                    explicitly hook it up to the data-bound control through the ItemTemplate property or the ContentTemplate
                    property.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we looked at ImplicitDataTemplates, which can auto-associate an appropriate DataTemplate based on the
                    data-bound object type, using the DataType property of the DataTemplate and the x:Type markup extension to
                    point to the data object type.
                </p>
                <p>Then we covered DataTemplateSelectors, which give you a chunk of logic that you can write to dynamically
                    determine which DataTemplate to use for a given data-bound object, and that logic can be based on whatever
                    criteria you want. It could be based on property values on the data-bound object, or other contextual
                    information about the execution environment, such as who the user is or what day it is.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, we finished off with HierarchicalDataTemplates, which apply the same capabilities to define the visual
                    structure, but now we're talking about nodes in a hierarchical tree based on a hierarchical data model. We saw
                    that HierarchicalDataTemplates let you specify what the child collections are at a given level in the
                    hierarchy, as well as what DataTemplate to use for the objects in that level.
