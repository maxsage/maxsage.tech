                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This module covers three iterations of the same demo application illustrating the following approaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No MVVM or data binding</li>
                    <li>Data binding only, no MVVM</li>
                    <li>MVVM</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Async in MVVM</h2>
                <p>
                    More and more applications have to deal with concept of Async and parallelism to provide a good user experience. In .Net we now have task
                    based async and async/await are the norm in .NET. For MVVM the ViewModel is often the initiator of calls that can take a long time in the
                    scheme of computation. These are the types of calls that should be made async to keep the UI responsive.

                <h2>Demo: Simple View with No MVVM or Data Binding</h2>
                <p>Dropbox\DevelopmentTutorials\WPFMVVMInDepth\2WPFMVVMInDepth\ZzaDashboard-NoDataBinding</p>
                <p>
                    The first demo is a very simple application that does not use MVVM or data binding. The solution consists of a WPF application
                    (ZzaDashboard). There is a database with tables for Customers, Products, and Orders etc. There is a Data Layer (Zza.Data) which is
                    pre-populated using Entity Framework DbContext and a set of Model objects including Customers, Products, and Orders etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the raw data access in Zza.Data there are two repositories one for Customers and the other for Orders. All the methods for
                    data access in these repositories are task based async methods. They are also Interface based classes to allow for easier unit testing.
                </p>
                <h2>Demo: Simple View with Data Binding</h2>
                <p>Dropbox\DevelopmentTutorials\WPFMVVMInDepth\2WPFMVVMInDepth\ZzaDashboard-DataBindingNoMVVM</p>
                <p>
                    The next variant provides the same functionality but implements data-binding to clean up the code a bit. Now the individual input controls
                    are using Two-way databinding where they bind to their DataContext and expose that DataContext to expose a LastName, FirstName and Phone
                    property. The Save button is just using a click handler to get to an OnSave() method in the code-behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code-behind is somewhat cleaner than the previous example. In the OnLoaded method we still call GetCustomerAsync from the repository
                    layer but then we can just push that to the DataContext:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="cs hljs">DataContext = _customer;</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The individual bindings in the View then have two-way data-binding against the properties exposed on the Model object. Two-way databinding
                    means any changes made by the user get written directly into that object. So, when it is time to Save we don’t have to gather any values
                    from the input controls (as we did in the previous example) because the data has already been transferred into that bound model object.
                </p>
                <h2>Demo: Simple View Transformed to MVVM</h2>
                <p>Dropbox\DevelopmentTutorials\WPFMVVMInDepth\2WPFMVVMInDepth\ZzaDashboard-SimpleMVVM</p>
                <p>Now we want to move relevant code out of the code-behind of the View. We need to break up our View into a View and ViewModel.</p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, in MainWindow.xaml we are still placing an instance of our View (CustomerEditView) into the container. We have removed the Customer
                    Id property as the data manipulation will be at the ViewModel level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In CustomerEditView.xaml the Loaded event has been removed. In terms of MVVM we are newing up an instance of our CustomerEditViewModel in
                    the XAML parsing process. The individual data bindings reference Customer.FirstName etc. We are expecting our ViewModel to expose a single
                    object called Customer.
                </p>
                <p>The Save button no longer performs click handling into the code behind. Instead it uses a Command object. So the Command property is bound to
                    another property exposed by our ViewModel called SaveCommand. We expect that to be an ICommand object. It will be invoked whenever the
                    button is clicked. It can also be used to enable and disable the button.
                </p>
                <p>At the top of the CustomerEditView.xaml file we define a Behaviour. It uses a behaviour from the Blend SDK called CallMethodAction which is
                    able to call a method on some object. In this scenario, we want to handle the Loaded event and despatch it as a method call invocation
                    against a method named LoadCustomer which is on our ViewModel. The binding specified in the TargetObject:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="cs hljs">“{Binding}”</code></pre>
                <p>Gives you a reference to the whole DataContext object or ViewModel.</p>
                <figure>

                    <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfmvvmindepth//Fig02-01.png"/>
                    <figcaption>Fig 02-01</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The ViewModel’s main job is to expose data. We are implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged event because we are not going to set that
                    Customer until our LoadCustomer method (this is being called from the Loaded event) gets invoked. By that point construction is already
                    done, the XAML parsing is done, all the Bindings have been evaluated so we need to be able to signal to the View that it should refresh its
                    data binding. That happens by firing the PropertyChanged event which is part of the INotifyPropertyChanged interface.
                </p>
                <p>Next we can see our SaveCommand property that we exposed publicly and bound to:</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfmvvmindepth/Fig02-02.png"/>
                    <figcaption>Fig 02-02</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>That gets hooked up in the Constructor which points it to the actual handling method itself (OnSave).</p>
                <p>Note that both the OnSave() and LoadCustomer() methods use task based async with the async/await keywords.</p>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    Data binding really lays the groundwork for MVVM. MVVM moves the data management interaction logic into the ViewModel. View-First
                    construction (where the ViewModel is constructed in the XAML through the mark-up) works out fine when you have static child Views inside a
                    container.
