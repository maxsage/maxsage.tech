                <h2>MVVM Pattern Fundamentals</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <p>
                    Every good WPF developer wants to write great applications that delight their users. You may be able to achieve that on a first release
                    without putting a lot of consideration into the structure of your application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MVVM pattern guides you to organize and structure your code to write maintainable, testable and extensible applications.
                </p>
                <h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
                <p>
                    MVVM is mostly about trying to achieve good separation of concerns. To explain separation of concerns I like to use an analogy of something
                    we all have to do: get dressed to go out in public. If you take your laundry and put it away as it comes out of the clothes drier – all
                    twisted and tangled with intermingled articles of clothing – that can really expedite the process of putting away your clothes at that
                    moment in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, you will pay an ongoing penalty each day when you need to get dressed because you will have to dig around to find a matching and
                    complete outfit from the tangled mess of clothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, on the other hand, you invest a little bit of time upfront to put in the structure in place to organize your clothes: buy a chest of
                    drawers, put in some shelves, put clothes away neatly each time the laundry is finished then the daily activity of getting dressed becomes a
                    breeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers face a very similar choice with the way we write code.
                </p>
                <h3>Separation of Concerns in MVVM</h3>
                <p>
                    Code like the example below doesn’t look too bad at first glance:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfmvvmindepth/Fig01-01.png"/>
                <p>
                    If you look closely at what the code is doing you can see code that is touching UI elements, interwoven with code that is doing data access,
                    interwoven with business logic code. Now put this into the context of a full application and you can start to appreciate how complex
                    maintaining and extending an application written in this way can be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MVVM provides a structure to promote good separation of concerns. Think of it as a set of shelves and drawers that are predefined and well
                    labelled. Each time you go to write code of a certain nature you have a specific place you should be putting it. There is a shelf for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>UI Element Access - that is your View definitions.</li>
                    <li>View Interaction Logic – that is you're ViewModels.</li>
                    <li>Model Entities – that is your Data Model Objects</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any true Business Logic should probably be in a separate layer or behind a service boundary.</p>
                <h3>MVVM Goals and Benefits</h3>
                <p>The three main benefits of using the MVVM pattern beyond achieving separation of concerns are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintainability</li>
                    <li>Testability</li>
                    <li>Extensibility</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Related UI Separation Patterns</h3>
                <p>
                    MVVM is an evolution of other separation of concern patterns. In the early 70’s when mainframes were heavily used the Model View Controller
                    pattern was first defined. This pattern was about rendering a screen of information to the user, collecting some input from them and
                    rendering the next screen of information to them. As a result of that Request/Response nature it is still a good fit for the modern web and
                    so is used by platforms such as ASP.Net MVC, Ruby on Rails and Angular.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key distinctions between MVVM and MVC is that there is typically a decoupled lifetime between the Controller and the View. The
                    Controller produces a View but may not stick around after that until a new request comes in from the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the mid 2000’s – Rich/Smart applications were getting a lot of attention. As a result, people started trying to use separation patterns
                    there. However, because the client Views were more state-full and stuck around in memory as did their supporting interaction logic, the MVC
                    pattern was not the perfect fit. What evolved was a nuance on the MVC pattern which was called the Model View Presenter. The distinction of
                    a Presenter versus a Controller was mostly that the lifetime of the Presenter and the View were coupled and they generally had a more
                    ongoing conversation as the user interacted with the View.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, that led to the newer MVVM pattern which was first defined in the early days of WPF by the Expression team at Microsoft. The main
                    difference here is that we are still dealing with rich desktop client applications and Views that stick around for longer interaction with
                    the user. The WPF platform offers really rich data-binding so MVVM is really a nuance on MVP where the explicit calls between the View and
                    its counterpart are replaced by Two-Way Databinding flowing data and communications between the View and the ViewModel.
                </p>
                <h3>MVVM across Platforms</h3>
                <p>
                    Since most WPF developers will not be coding exclusively from WPF you should be aware that MVVM can be used on most modern client
                    applications today such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>WPF</li>
                    <li>Silverlight</li>
                    <li>Window 8/WinRT</li>
                    <li>HTML 5 (Knockout/Angular)</li>
                    <li>Xamarin/Mobile Apps</li>
                    <li>Windows 10</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>MVVM Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    Each part of the MVVM pattern has a distinct responsibility. MVVM is really a layered architecture for the client side. The Presentation
                    layer is composed of the Views, the Logic Layer are the ViewModels and the Persistence Layer is the combination of the Model Objects and the
                    Client Services that produce and persists them either via data access in a two-tier application or via service calls in an n-tier
                    application.
                </p>
                <h3>Model Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    The Model is really the client side data model that supports the Views in the application. It is composed of objects with properties and
                    backing member variables that hold the discreet pieces of data in memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of those properties may reference other Model objects forming the object graph that is the model object as a whole. The Model objects
                    may also expose computed objects (properties whose value is computer based on the value of other properties in the model (e.g. FullName) or
                    information from the client execution context (e.g. Time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because you will often be binding to Model properties the Model objects should raise Property Change Notifications. For WPF data-binding
                    this means implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and firing the PropertyChanged event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you will often embed Validation information on the model objects so it can work with the WPF data-binding validation features
                    through Interfaces such as INotifyDataErrorInfo and IDataErrorInfo.
                </p>
                <h3>View Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    The Views responsibility is to define the structure of what the user sees on the screen. That structure can be composed of static and
                    dynamic parts. Static being the XAML hierarchy that defines the controls and layout of controls that the View is composed of and dynamic
                    being any animations or state changes that are defined as part of the View.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is an overarching goal in MVVM to have “no code behind” in the View. However, you do sometimes need to put a bit of code in the code
                    behind - at least the constructor and call to InitializeComponent() that triggers XAML parsing when the View is constructed but also things
                    such as any code that references a UI element as that is inherently View code (things like animations expressed in code are one example).
                </p>
                <h3>ViewModel Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    The ViewModel is the focal point of coding up an MVVM application. The primary responsibility of a ViewModel is provide data to the View so
                    the View can put it on the screen and, if appropriate, let the user interact with and change that data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the ViewModel encapsulates the interaction logic for a View. That doesn’t mean that all of the logic of the application should
                    go into the ViewModel. That would just create a new place where separation of concerns is being violated. The following should be present in
                    the ViewModel:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Calls to business/data layer/service</li>
                    <li>Navigation logic</li>
                    <li>State transformation logic</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In terms of the data that the ViewModel provides to the View there are really three types of data to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Model objects directly through ViewModel properties</li>
                    <li>Wrapped Model objects – not direct Model object references</li>
                    <li>Client application state (e.g. User logged in)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Client Services Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    There is one more layer that is not officially part of the MVVM pattern but is often used with MVVM to further separate concerns and avoid
                    duplicate code – the Client services layer.
                </p>
                <p>Client services encapsulate any shared logic that spans more than one ViewModel.</p>
                <h3>Equation of MVVM</h3>
                <p>Another key concept to lock in your brain is what is sometimes called the Fundamental equation of MVVM:</p>
                <p>View.DataContext = ViewModel</p>
                <p>The View’s DataContext property needs to be set to a reference of the ViewModel instance for that View.</p>
                <h3>Who’s on First</h3>
                <p>
                    Who constructs who? View-First and ViewModel-First refer to which object is constructed first and does it construct the other as part of its
                    own construction or initialization process. Different approaches will typically be used in different parts of an application.
                </p>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    MVVM helps you build better structured apps. Each part of the MVVM pattern has specific responsibilities that guide you to put code in the
                    right place. Finally, to get MVVM up and running you must satisfy the fundamental equation of MVVM:
                </p>
                <p>View.DataContext = ViewModel</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
