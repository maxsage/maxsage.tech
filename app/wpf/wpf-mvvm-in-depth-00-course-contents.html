                <h4>MVVM Pattern Fundamentals</h4>

                <p>
                    It starts by explaining seperation of concerns and how MVVM helps you structure your code to achieve this. It then moves on to
                    briefly discuss other UI Seperation patterns such as MVP and MVC. The next sections cover the responsibilities of the Model, View,
                    ViewModel and Client Services components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final part of this model discusses the Equation of MVVM: View.DataContext = ViewModel and the order in which the various
                    components get constructed.
                </p>
                <h4>First Taste of MVVM</h4>
                <a [routerLink]="['WPFMVVMInDepth02FirstTasteOfMVVM']">First Taste of MVVM</a>
                <p>This module first covers Asynchronous operations in MVVM. The next sections detail three demos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demo: Simple View with No MVVM or Data Binding</li>
                    <li>Demo: Simple View with Data Binding</li>
                    <li>Demo: Simple View Transformed to MVVM</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Hooking up Views and ViewModels in MVVM</h4>
                <a [routerLink]="['WPFMVVMInDepth03HookingUpViewsAndViewModelsInMVVM']">Hooking up Views and ViewModels in MVVM</a>
                <p>
                    This module starts by going into more detail regarding View-First Construction and View-First with ViewModelLocators. It then covers
                    data binding support for MVVM. The next section covers ViewModel-First Construction with DataTemplates.
                </p>
                <h4>View/ViewModel Communication in WPF</h4>
                <a [routerLink]="['WPFMVVMInDepth04ViewViewModelCommunicationInWPF']">View/ViewModel Communication in WPF</a>
                <p>
                    The first topic this module covers is using Commands for View to ViewModel Communication. It then moves on to discuss Attached
                    Properties and Behaviors and how the form a communication path between Views and ViewModels for scenario's where Commands and
                    Property Change Notifications are not sufficient.
                </p>
                <p>The next section covers Property Change Notifications and implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface which can be used to
                    notify the View when the underlying data changes.
                </p>
                <h4>Applied MVVM Part 1 - Hierarchies and Navigation</h4>
                <a [routerLink]="['WPFMVVMInDepth05AppliedMVVMPart1HierarchiesAndNavigation']">Applied MVVM Part 1 - Hierarchies and Navigation</a>
                <p>
                    This module starts by covering the MVVM component naming conventions and where you should locate your components (by feature or by
                    type - the author opts for by type for the demos in this course).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next section discusses Hierarchy and Navigation. if you have a hierarchy of Views and ViewModels the Parent ViewModel can become
                    a hub for communications so that each Child ViewModel can remain decoupled from the other Child ViewModels and from their Parent as
                    much as possible.
                </p>
                <p>The rest of this module is composed of several demos:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Building out an MVVM Hierarchy</li>
                    <li>Encapsulating INotifyPropertyChanged</li>
                    <li>View Switching Navigation</li>
                    <li>Data Loading into a ViewModel</li>
                    <li>Navigation with Parameters</li>
                    <li>Add/Edit Navigation</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Applied MVVM Part 2 - Validation and Dependency Injection</h4>
                <a [routerLink]="['WPFMVVMInDepth06AppliedMVVMPart2ValidationAndDependencyInjection']">Applied MVVM Part 2 - Validation and Dependency Injection</a>
                <p>
                    The final module starts by covering how the Visual Studio Designer and Data Sources can be used to quickly scaffold data bound
                    forms. Next this module covers Wrapping Model Objects which can be used when you want to add additional properties and functionality
                    (like implementing INotifyPropertyChanged) that your model objects don't provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then there is a demo covering Command Handling and Converters. The author describes using a form for both Adding and Editing
                    Customer records, setting the visibility of the buttons accordingly. So the buttons use Commanding and the Visibility is setup as a
                    custom Converter.
                </p>
                <p>The next topic is Validation in MVVM</p>
                <p>
                    After that Dependency Injection is covered which facilitates the decoupling of ViewModels from our Client Services (e.g. the
                    repository service can be injected into our ViewModel using a dependency injection container such as Unity.
                </p>
                <p>The final demo covers Searching and Filtering Data.</p>
                <p>Finally various MVVM toolkits such as Prism, MVVM Light and Caliburn Micro are discussed.</p>
