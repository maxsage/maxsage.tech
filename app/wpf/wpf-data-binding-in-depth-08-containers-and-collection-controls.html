                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hi, this is Brian Noyes. In this module, we're going to dive into some of the containment scenarios and the
                    dynamic generation of contained controls based on data binding.
                </p>
                <p> We'll also look in more depth at the common collection controls, including ListBox, ComboBox, TabControl and
                    DataGrid. And we'll finish off by talking a little bit more about collection views, which can be used to
                    modify the collections you're data-bound to.
                </p>
                <p>So first up, we're going to dive into what's really going on at runtime when you have a data-driven control and
                    the composition that happens with the UI elements that are generated based on the data. I'll quickly explain
                    what's going on in concept with bullets, and then we'll dive into a demo that hopefully makes it all clear,
                    since it is dynamic in nature.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we'll review ComboBoxes and ListBoxes and the key data binding properties and behaviors there. We've seen
                    a lot of this in previous demos, but in those previous demos I just kind of glanced over it and didn't focus
                    one at a time on the properties you'll care about.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we'll get into TabControls, which TabControls are more of a structural element, but they can be
                    data-driven themselves. So we'll see a common scenario where you can use TabControls for child view
                    containment that can be dynamically-driven through data binding.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we'll get into the Ubiquitous DataGrid and we'll focus on some of the key properties that you'll need to
                    know to really drive a DataGrid in normal data binding scenarios. There are, naturally, all kinds of deep,
                    dark corners in the DataGrid and lots of fancy customizations of appearance and things that are out of scope
                    for this course. What I'm going to focus on are the things that really drive the behavior of the DataGrid,
                    based on it being data-bound.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, we'll finish out this module by revisiting Collection Views. I talked about the ICollectionView
                    interface in an earlier module, and we looked at the notion of currency driven by Collection Views. Here we're
                    going to focus on some other things it can do for you in terms of manipulating the collection that you're
                    working with to do things like sorting, filtering, grouping, and master-details presentations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Container Controls</h3>
                <p>Let's talk quickly, in concept, about the data-driven visual composition of data-bound controls, and then we'll
                    see how it really works in the demo. So mainly what I'm focusing on here are ContentControls and
                    ItemsControls. And these controls, when you're using data binding, can dynamically generate child elements.
                </p>
                <p>They do it based on the data-bound objects that they're pointed to. Generally, it's going to be based on
                    DataTemplates, but in the case of ItemsControls, the derived types, such as ListBox and ComboBox, have other
                    properties that can decide what to render just based on the data itself.
                </p>
                <p>When you're working with ContentControl, it's going to generate a ContentPresenter, and the ContentPresenter is
                    going to become the container for the data-driven content, whatever you're setting as the Content property on
                    the ContentControl through data binding.
                </p>
                <p>ContentPresenter is also going to show up in a lot of other controls. A Window has a root ContentPresenter it
                    uses to show the child area, UserControls derive from ContentControl, TabControls contain multiple
                    ContentControls, DataGridCells, and so on, they all use ContentPresenters to render out their data-driven
                    content.
                </p>
                <p>And ultimately, the DataContext is going to be set on this element as the ContentObject that's being rendered
                    out, and that's going to flow down the visual tree into something like a DataTemplate that's being rendered as
                    the content.
                </p>
                <p>When you're working with ItemsControls, it's going to be an ItemsPresenter as opposed to a ContentPresenter.
                    Similar concept, it's the single root container for each of the items rendered out by that ItemsControl. And
                    that is going to be a specific Type based on the control that's actually rendering, so there's a ComboBoxItem
                    Type, ListBoxItem Type, TabItem, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>When it goes and renders out one of those items, generally somewhere down the chain of that item there's going
                    to be a ContentPresenter because that item represents a single piece of content, and the way a single piece of
                    content gets rendered out in a data-bound scenario is through a ContentPresenter.
                </p>
                <p>And just like with a ContentPresenter inside a ContentControl, the DataContext on each item container,
                    specifically, ComboBoxItem, ListBoxItem, and so on, is going to be set to the individual data object that's
                    being rendered out within that ItemsControl.
                </p>
                <p>So that's a lot of words and lofty concepts. Let's drill into a demo that will make this more concrete by
                    digging in to the visual tree and seeing what's going on when data binding is happening.

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I want to get familiar with the dynamic generation of data-bound elements when you're working
                    with ContentControls and ItemsControls in data binding scenarios. These controls generate the rendering of the
                    data-bound objects dynamically, and that adds elements to the visual tree.
                </p>
                <p>Understanding what's going on down at that level can be very helpful in diagnosing and debugging problems when
                    they occur in your UI and in data binding scenarios. But because none of those elements exist in design time,
                    if you haven't seen it in action, you may not know where to go.
                </p>
                <p>Starting point for this demo is a simple WPF project:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-001.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That already has a little bit of code in the code-behind for going out and getting the Products Collection from
                    our ZzaDBContext, similar to previous demos:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-002.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And pushing it into a CollectionViewSource that's already up inside the View.</p>
                <p>The code-behind also has some Helper code that's basically going to generate a Tree View, based on a node in
                    the visual tree. So I've got a Helper method here called GetTreeFromNode:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-003.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That's basically going to start at the current node and walk down using a Helper down below called
                    GetVisualTree.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-004.png" class="image"/>
                <p>GetVisualTree uses the VisualTreeHelper class in WPF to walk through all the children of the current node, and
                    then recursively, notice the call to GetVisualTree here, recursively walk down to its children. It's basically
                    generating a TreeViewItem, which is a node for a Tree View for each item in the visual tree from the object
                    that you pass in, annotating the node that you started with by square brackets.
                </p>
                <p>After it's walked down from the current node to all its children generating a tree, it then starts walking
                    up:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-005.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So it has another Helper method down below called GetParent:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-006.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That will get the ParentElement of the current node and then it uses that in a loop to walk up the tree and get
                    each one of the parents until you get to the root of the visual tree.
                </p>
                <p>The TreeViewItem that comes out of this can be passed this helper called ShowTree:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-007.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That's going to basically create a TreeView, put that root node into it, and pop it up in a window. So we're
                    going to use this as a crude visualization of the visual tree and the elements that we're working with.
                </p>
                <p>So to get started, let's go over to our UI and I'm just going to drag out a simple TextBox:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-008.png" class="image"/>
                <p>seemingly simple control, and we will give it a name of TextBox1. I could then drop into my code-behind and use
                    my Helper methods to visualize the visual tree from that node. So I'm going to go in here and say,
                    ShowTree(GetTreeFromNode(TextBox1)):
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-009.png" class="image"/>
                <p>If we go ahead and run, we can see the TextBox loads up there and we've got our visual tree here, starting at
                    the root, which is the window, down through the Grid that's its child. There's our TextBox, then notice that
                    the TextBox itself contains a Border, ScrollViewer, Grid, Rectangle, ScrollContentPresenter, TextBoxViews, and
                    blah, blah, blah.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-010.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So the point is, any given element within WPF that you declare at design time, can have some complex structure
                    generated at runtime based on that declaration.
                </p>
                <p>In this case, what you're seeing is the default ControlTemplate for a TextBox, so this stuff is not so much
                    being generated dynamically based on data, it's just part of the internal structure of a TextBox. Any control
                    in WPF is going to have some amount of that, but what we're going to focus on next is the dynamic generation
                    of elements based on data.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Demo: Dynamic Data Control Visual Tree</h3>
                <p>So instead of that, if I replace my TextBox with a ContentControl:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-011.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and we just use a binding that takes in whatever the current DataContext is, which is going to be the
                    collection coming out of this CollectionViewSource.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-012.png" class="image"/>
                <p>If we then dump the tree on that ContentControl, and run, now we can see something similar get down to the Grid
                    to the ContentControl, but notice this child element called ContentPresenter:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-013.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The DataContext on this, notice we're also dumping what the DataContext is at a given level so that we can see
                    where that switches in data-bound scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>The DataContext is null on the ContentPresenter because it doesn't have anything to render yet, and we'll see
                    that switch momentarily. But notice that the Collection View flows down to the ContentControl and then the
                    ContentControl is going to render out a ContentPresenter for whatever it's trying to dynamically render we
                    need to give it a template to be able to render.
                </p>
                <p>So how can we set the template of a ContentControl? Well we could use a number of different ways, but I'm just
                    going to set an explicit template setting the ContentTemplate property equal to an instance of a DataTemplate
                    containing a TextBlock:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-014.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That TextBlock is bound to the Name property of the product that's being rendered. And because of the way
                    ListViews work, that was covered in a previous module, even this binding is pointing to a whole collection,
                    ContentControl is going to render out the current item in that collection.
                </p>
                <p>So let's go ahead and run with that, and now we can see in the window behind there, Plain Cheese is showing
                    up:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-015.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That's because that's the current product name. If we drill down in the tree now, we can see we get down to the
                    ContentPresenter level:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-016.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and notice now it does have the DataContext is that ListCollectionView, but then immediately underneath that it
                    renders an instance of our TextBlock and that DataContext flows down to it.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-017.png" class="image"/>
                <p>But because the control is designed to work with a single object, it will pick the current object out of that
                    collection and bind against the Name property of that current object. So notice the ContentPresenter's role
                    here in a ContentControl, it is the thing that will render out the DataTemplate inside of it.
                </p>
                <p>Now what if we go with a little more complicated control, such as a ListBox bound to the entire collection?</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-018.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And in this case, we've got DisplayMemberPath set to Name. If we add that and dump that in a tree instead:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-019.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and go ahead and run, now we can see the dump here behind.</p>
                <p>You can see the ListBox is populated. You can start drilling down. Here's our ListBox:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-020.png" class="image"/>
                <p>It's got some structure with Border, ScrollViewer, Grid, etc., eventually a ScrollContentPresenter, and then
                    notice ItemsPresenter.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-021.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So for a ContentControl it's a ContentPresenter, that renders out the dynamic item. In an ItemsControl it's an
                    ItemsPresenter that renders out the dynamic items (plural).
                </p>
                <p>But then notice we get down to a level called the VirtualizingStackPanel:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-022.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Which is the default presenter for a ListBox, and we can't drill down any deeper because the individual items
                    are being rendered out dynamically in a way that the VisualTreeHelper can't get to.
                </p>
                <p>So how can we get to those to visualize their structure? Well, if we go to our ListBox and add an ItemTemplate
                    to it and get rid of our DisplayMemberPath:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-023.png" class="image"/>
                <p>this ItemTemplate just contains a TextBlock bound to the Name property of the product again, similar to what
                    the DisplayMemberPath was doing, but here we can now hook up a Loaded event that we can then tap into the
                    object that's raising that event, which will be the TextBlock down inside of the ListBox, then we can walk the
                    visual tree from there.
                </p>
                <p>So let's go hook up this Loaded event. So I'll jump into the code-behind and add the Loaded event here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-024.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We only want this to fire once, not once for each item, so I've got a little guard condition here to make sure
                    it only executes once.
                </p>
                <p>And then we're going to do the ShowTree call for that sender object that's raising the event:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-025.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which will be the individual TextBlock inside of the ListBox.</p>
                <p>I'll comment out the other ShowTree:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-026.png" class="image"/>
                <p>so we don't get two of them popping up, and let's run with that. Now we can expand down and we can see we get
                    down to the VirtualizingStackPanel level, but we're actually walking up to that level so we're able to walk
                    through it, and notice there's a ListBoxItem, and also notice the DataContext switch at this point.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-027.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So the true container of an item in the ListBox is a ListBoxItem. If it's a ComboBox, it's a ComboBoxItem; if
                    it's a TabControl, it's a TabItem. So each control has its own item container that it will render out, and
                    that's really the point where it switches from the overall collection to an individual object in that
                    collection as far as the DataContext.
                </p>
                <p>That flows down the visual tree from there, and inside of that is a ContentPresenter:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-028.png" class="image"/>
                <p>because the ListBoxItem is effectively a ContentControl. Inside of the ContentPresenter, that's where our
                    DataTemplate renders.
                </p>
                <p>So you can see, now we're able to walk up the visual tree, basically, from that TextBlock in the event handler,
                    all the way up and see the internals of what's going on inside this VirtualizingStackPanel, and it emphasizes
                    that's the point where the DataContext switches.
                </p>
                <p>Now let's take an even more dynamic and complicated data-bound container, a DataGrid:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-029.png" class="image"/>
                <p>A DataGrid is going to render out rows for each object in the collection. Those rows have composite structure
                    of their own. And similar to what I showed with the ListBox, if I just tried to drill down from the DataGrid,
                    I wouldn't be able to get past the Row level, the ItemsPresenter level.
                </p>
                <p>So I'm going to play a similar trick here, that I'm going to use a TemplatedColumn:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-030.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which we'll get into more details on later in the module, and provide a DataTemplate containing a TextBlock
                    bound to the Description field with a Loaded event hooked up on it.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-031.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I can hook that Loaded event and do my tree walk from there, similar to what I just showed with the ListBox.
                </p>
                <p>So let's drop into the code-behind, add that event handler, we'll do our ShowTree on the object that's raising
                    the Loaded event, which will be our TextBlock inside of a cell within the DataGrid, and we've got our guard
                    condition to make sure we only do it once.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-032.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Let's go ahead and run, and now we can see a DataGrid showing up there:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-033.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We can drill our way down. Notice the ItemsPresenter in this case is a DataGridRowsPresenter:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-034.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and this is the level where we wouldn't be able to drill down any farther if we hadn't hooked the event down
                    inside of a DataTemplate, but we're really drilling up to that point, so you can see that renders out
                    DataGridRows as the containers.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-035.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Those have some structure to them. Eventually you get to a DataGridCellsPresenter, which contains an
                    ItemsPresenter itself.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-036.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So you've actually got ItemsControl behavior at a Row level:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-037.png" class="image"/>
                <p>but then within a Row, you've got ItemsControl rendering of the individual cells within the Row.</p>
                <p>Notice in terms of DataContext switching, the Context switch happens at a Row level:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-038.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The entire Row's DataContext is the Product, and from there down.</p>
                <p>Inside of the Cells, we've got a DataGridCellsPanel, eventually a DataGridCell is the container for a single
                    cell. There's our ContentPresenter again, the thing that's going to render out our DataContext for that cell.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-039.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The other thing to note here, that we'll talk about more in the DataGrid section of this module, notice there's
                    no Column objects anywhere here. Columns don't really exist in terms of the object model of a DataGrid at
                    runtime. They're explicitly part of the way you declare the DataGrid at design time, but the rendering
                    actually happens at a Row level and then walking across the cells of a row, not in a column-oriented fashion.
                </p>
                <p>And this really emphasizes the pivotal role of the ItemsPresenter here and here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-040.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And the ContentPresenter here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-041.png" class="image"/>
                <p>for dynamically rendering out the data-driven content of a data-bound control.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Now the other thing I wanted to point out is there are some tools out there that can help you with all this
                    data visualization and visual tree inspection. You don't necessarily have to write these tree dumpers in your
                    code yourself. The first is one called Mole for Visual Studio:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-042.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and this is a debugging visualizer that plugs into either Visual Studio 2013 or 2012 or prior. The other is a
                    tool called WPF Inspector:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-043.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which you can find out on CodePlex.</p>
                <p>And there's a new XAML -Inspector coming that will work with other XAML technologies in a similar way. I've got
                    both of these available here, so let me start up the app that I put together in the previous demo, and we're
                    hitting a breakpoint for a DataGridCell_Loaded that's being triggered from a template down inside of the
                    DataGrid.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-044.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now when you use Mole, it's a debugger visualizer, which means you can walk up to an object in your
                    environment, go to this little magnifying glass drop it down, and you can see Mole 2012.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-045.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I click on that, and it brings up the MoloScope:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-046.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So Mole gives you, over here on the left you can see, it's broken down the visual tree similar to what I did in
                    my demo:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-047.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So you've got this Visual Tree TreeView that you can drill through and see all the same kind of stuff rendered
                    out a little nicer than what I was doing.
                </p>
                <p> Also, anything you select in here over on the right, you're able to see all of the properties of that object,
                    inspect them, and even edit some of them:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-048.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So if you want to tweak with styling and things like that, you can do that in here and see what it's going to
                    look like.
                </p>
                <p>And if you select a given item up above, you can go down here on the bottom left, click to refresh, it's going
                    to show you what the XAML would look like for that single thing
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-049.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and you can go into Snapshot and it will render out just that single item.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-050.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So here we can see we're seeing just a Description cell that would be within the DataGrid. So in terms of being
                    able to walk up to any element in a running application and start inspecting and tweaking it, Mole is very
                    nice for that.
                </p>
                <p>The other tool that's very handy here is WPF Inspector. So if I go start up WPF Inspector, and you do have to
                    run this as an administrator, that's an important trick, because it has to have the process rights to be able
                    to go and inspect another process:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-051.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So notice it shows MainWindow here, that's my running MainWindow. I can attach to that, and it brings up this
                    window that's kind of laid out similar to what Mole had:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-052.png" class="image"/>
                <p>You can see we can start drilling down in the visual tree.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-053.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now in this case I'm drilling down from the top down and we can see I can drill into something like my ListBox
                    and this will let me drill down through that ItemsPresenter and VirtualizingStackPanel, and now I can see the
                    ListBoxItems rendered out.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-054.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So I don't have to hook those lower-level events with WPF Inspector to drill all the way down the visual tree.
                    This, you can see if you hover over an item, gives you a rendering of what that item looks like in the overall
                    context
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-055.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and the other thing that's going on here, it's hard to see with the small screen here, but notice as I make
                    selections in WPF Inspector, it's actually putting a red box around them in the running UI with some
                    measurements.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-056.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Over on the right, similar to Mole, it has the property values so you can inspect those for the currently
                    selected item:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-057.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and you can do other things with it inspecting the DataContext that's there:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-058.png" class="image"/>
                <p>even tweaking the values to see what it would look like in the UI. So we could go tweak the name of an item
                    here:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-059.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and tab out of there, minimize this, and we can see it actually dynamically changed it in the running UI.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-060.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So very handy tool to be aware of for digging into your visual tree, seeing what's there, understanding what's
                    there, and playing with values in it.
                </p>
                <p>So both Mole and WPF Inspector are very handy tools to have in your arsenal to be able to drill in and inspect
                    your visual tree, visualize things, and make tweaks to them.
                </p>
                <p>And in the context of these demos, for really understanding what's being dynamically generated at an
                    ItemsPresenter and ContentPresenter level, and what the DataContexts are, to make sure your data binding is
                    working out the way you expect it to.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>ComboBoxes and ListBoxes</h3>
                <p>ComboBoxes and ListBoxes are a mainstay of data-bound scenarios, so let's review the key properties you're
                    going to want to have at the tip of your fingers every time you go to do data binding with these.
                </p>
                <p>First off, they both derive from ItemsControl, so all the concepts around ItemsControls and ItemsPresenters and
                    things we've been talking about so far, apply. The data binding properties that are going to be most important
                    to you include, first and foremost the ItemsSource. This is the one you're going to set to a collection that's
                    going to render out the individual items within the ComboBox or ListBox.
                </p>
                <p>Next, if you want to keep it simple, you can use the DisplayMemberPath property. DisplayMemberPath is going to
                    be the name of a property on each data-bound object that you want turned into a string and rendered as a
                    string within the ComboBox or ListBox. If you need to start using the SelectedItem, then you're going to have
                    some value that you want to associate with it, so SelectedValuePath lets you point to a different property, or
                    possibly the same property, on each data-bound object to identify the value of each item. Typically, this is
                    going to be an Id-like property, something like a primary key type property that you can use to go and
                    retrieve the whole object from a database or to transmit that Id around as a unique identifier for a
                    particular object.
                </p>
                <p>Hand-in-hand with SelectedValuePath is the SelectedValue property. This is the thing you can inspect when the
                    user is interacting with the control to see what the value of that property indicated by SelectedValuePath is,
                    on the currently selected object.
                </p>
                <p>Next, if you want to deal with the whole selected object, then you can use SelectedItem. This is going to pass
                    a reference to the entire selected object to whoever calls it. And both SelectedValue and SelectedItem become
                    good candidates for data binding to push the SelectedValue or SelectedItem through a binding in a two-way data
                    binding fashion to some property either in your code-behind or in something like a ViewModel that logic is
                    then later going to act on based on what's selected.
                </p>
                <p>As we saw in a previous module, if you want to start driving the visual appearance of each item with something
                    more than just a string, then you can provide an ItemTemplate, and that ItemTemplate is a DataTemplate to
                    render out each item with whatever visual structure you want, containing embedded bindings to the properties
                    of the current item.
                </p>
                <p>Now there's one other property on a ListBox to be aware of, called SelectedItems, because ListBoxes support
                    multi-select scenarios. The problem with SelectedItems is, it's not a good candidate for data binding. It's a
                    read-only property, so you can't set it through a data binding.
                </p>
                <p>Now there is kind of an advanced way you can deal with this if you've been exposed to the concept of behaviors,
                    either attach behaviors or blend behaviors, these are extensibility points you can write and embed in your
                    XAML.
                </p>
                <p>You could write a custom behavior that monitors the SelectionChanged event of the ItemsControl, reads the
                    values from SelectedItems, and then pushes those values as a collection through some property that the
                    behavior exposes through a binding, but doing that goes a little bit beyond the scope of this course.
                </p>
                <p>So let's dive into a demo that reviews all of these important properties and how to use them in ComboBoxes and
                    ListBoxes.

                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I want to walk you through the basics of ComboBoxes and ListBoxes. We've seen these in a number
                    of demos before, but I didn't really spend time focusing on each of the data-bound properties and how they
                    relate to one another, so I just wanted to revisit them comprehensively since they're such a pivotal
                    data-bound control.
                </p>
                <p>Starting point for this demo is a simple WPF application project with a MainWindow in it:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-061.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and I added a MainWindowViewModel. In the MainWindowViewModel constructor, we're doing some data retrieval:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-062.png" class="image"/>
                <p>As usual, we're using our ZzaDBContext to go out to a Zza database, we're getting some products and pushing
                    them into an ObservableCollection.
                </p>
                <p>That collection is exposed as a property called Products on our ViewModel that we can data bind to:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-063.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We're also modifying the Image property of each product to point to a collection of Images that's in our
                    project under the Images subfolder.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-064.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And we're setting two other properties on initialization here, the SelectedProductId and SelectedProduct, which
                    are both exposed as properties on our ViewModel here.
                </p>
                <p>So this just gives us a good DataContext to data bind against for our ComboBoxes and ListBoxes. We also have a
                    RelayCommand in the project, which we've seen in previous demos:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-065.png" class="image"/>
                <p>just an ICommand object we can use to hook up buttons to point to handling in our ViewModel, which we'll get
                    to.
                </p>
                <p>So if I drop into my MainWindow and add a basic ComboBox here, the basic structure is that it is an
                    ItemsControl
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-066.png" class="image"/>
                <p>so the most important property that you're going to want to set in data binding is the ItemsSource property.
                </p>
                <p>Here we're pointing to a Products path on whatever our DataContext is, and you can see up above our DataContext
                    is already wired up so that our MainWindowViewModel is our DataContext:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-067.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So this will cause it to be constructed, the constructor fires and loads the products, and then data binding
                    fires and reads those products into our ComboBox.
                </p>
                <p>If that's all we put on our ComboBox and try to run, as we've seen before, that's not quite enough, because
                    it's just going to ToString each of the Product objects and that's not really what we want:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-068.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So at a bare minimum, when using a ComboBox, you're going to want to set the DisplayMemberPath property and
                    I'll set that to Name.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-069.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That basically says, go to the Name property on each of those products, get that out as a string, and then it's
                    going to render a TextBlock, basically, inside of the ComboBox list for each one of those.
                </p>
                <p>So running with that, now we get something a little more like what we expect.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-070.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we see the names of each of the products in our ComboBox. Notice that it started with nothing selected, and
                    that's where some of the other data-bound properties can come in. Another one, if you're using
                    DisplayMemberPath, that you'll often use, is SelectedValuePath.
                </p>
                <p>SelectedValuePath lets you point to another property on each one of your data-bound objects that contains some
                    sort of identifier typically. So in our case, we can use the Id property.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-071.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Hand-in-hand with the SelectedValuePath is the SelectedValue property, and this is one that you can
                    programmatically inspect based on events.
                </p>
                <p>If you were to hook the SelectionChanged event, for example, you could then get the SelectedValue or the
                    SelectedIndex or the SelectedItem, but in a data-bound scenario you might push this value through data binding
                    into some property, especially in a ViewModel type scenario.
                </p>
                <p>So we could set up a binding on this and point it to our SelectedProductId property on our ViewModel, like
                    so.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-072.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now, if we go ahead and run, notice that the ComboBox is not empty initially:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-073.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and that's because of our initialization code back here in the ViewModel. Remember we loaded up the products,
                    but we also initialized the SelectedProductId property to the first item in those products.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-074.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Another one you could do as an alternative to SelectedValue, you generally won't do both of these, is the
                    SelectedItem property:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-075.png" class="image"/>
                <p>SelectedItem gets the whole data-bound object, which will be a Product object in this case, and pushes it
                    through a binding to a property in our ViewModel in this case.
                </p>
                <p>That, likewise, was being initialized in the constructor to the first item in the list:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-076.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So we should see that selected now when it starts up. And we could go back here into our SelectedProduct
                    setter, set a breakpoint, and see whenever it's set, our set block is being called, so we have an opportunity
                    to invoke some logic there based on the product that's being selected.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-077.png" class="image"/>
                <p>If we want to have more structure to the elements within our ComboBox, we could use a DataTemplate:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-078.png" class="image"/>
                <p>in this case, an ImplicitDatatemplate, but of course, an explicit one would work as well. This DataTemplate is
                    mapped to the Product Type and it uses the Image property to render out an Image and a TextBlock to render out
                    the Name. With that in place, it would do nothing if we don't get rid of the DisplayMemberPath property:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-079.png" class="image"/>
                <p>because those two are incompatible.</p>
                <p>When you say DisplayMemberPath, you're saying you just want to render out text based on that property, so we
                    can get rid of both DisplayMemberPath and SelectedValuePath:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-080.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which is not being used anymore, and go ahead and run this.</p>
                <p>And now we can see that the individual items in our ComboBox have the structure that we determined in our
                    DataTemplate:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-081.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and obviously we'd want to do some sizing on the ComboBox itself so we could show a whole item when selected.
                    So those are the primary things you're going to use on a ComboBox.
                </p>
                <p>Always an ItemsSource when you're data binding, DisplayMemberPath and SelectedValuePath if you're just dealing
                    with simple text rendering, and the SelectedValue property to do something with it or the SelectedItem
                    property to push the whole object when selected, and then to put more structure on the rendering, use
                    DataTemplates.
                </p>
                <p>All those same concepts apply to a ListBox. I could go in here and add a ListBox bound to Products here.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-082.png" class="image"/>
                <p>DisplayMemberPath would, again, apply, as would SelectedItem, SelectedValue, SelectedValuePath, and so on.</p>
                <p>I'm going to go ahead and run here with both the ComboBox and ListBox bound to Products to emphasize something
                    about synchronization.
                </p>
                <p>So right now, notice I can make a selection in the ListBox and it has no impact on the ComboBox, and
                    vice-versa.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-083.png" class="image"/>
                <p>When you have two data-bound controls pointing to the same collection by default, there is a
                    CollectionViewSource associated with them, but they are not synchronized with that current item in the
                    CollectionViewSource.
                </p>
                <p>If you have two things like that and you want them to stay in synch, this is where the
                    IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem property comes in. Go ahead and set that to True on both of these items:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-084.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and run again, and now we can see if I select Holy Smokes up above, it's highlighted in the list below, Italian
                    Stallion down below, it's selected up above.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-085.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now another thing you might sometimes want to do is have some other UI that is driving the selection in a
                    ComboBox, ListBox or DataGrid. So here I'm going to add a simple little Search UI:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-086.png" class="image"/>
                <p>a TextBox and a button that we can trigger. The TextBox is going to be bound to a property on our ViewModel
                    called SearchInput:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-087.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and the button is bound to a command that we're going to add.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-088.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So first let me drop back to the ViewModel and add those two properties. So here's our SearchInput as a string
                    input:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-089.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and here's our SetProductCommand as a RelayCommand.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-090.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we need to initialize that ProductCommand, so in the constructor up here, we can initialize it and point it
                    to a method called OnSetProduct:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-091.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and I can declare that method down below here.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-092.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And you can see when that gets called through the command, I'm going to go out and use the SearchInput text,
                    which was pushed through thanks to two-way data binding, when I click on the button, changes focus, that
                    causes the current value in the TextBox to be pushed down into that SearchInput and that makes it available to
                    do a Search here against our Products based on the Name property, and then we will push that into the
                    SelectedProduct property.
                </p>
                <p>That's going to call the setter</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-093.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which raises a PropertyChanged event, and because our SelectedItem is bound to that SelectedProduct:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-094.png" class="image"/>
                <p>that's going to cause the ComboBox to change. Because the ComboBox changes and IsSynchronized is set on both of
                    these, it will also cause the ListBox to change. So let's go ahead and run with that, and we can see down
                    below there's a product called Taj Mahal. If I just put in Taj and Search:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-095.png" class="image"/>
                <p>You can see it's selected up above and selected down below. Put in Smokes, Search, Holy Smokes selected in both
                    controls.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-096.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So that just further emphasizes the way you can bind SelectedItem, for example, or SelectedValue, change the
                    thing it's bound to in the code-behind, and that will drive what's selected in the UI, a very common thing to
                    do in Model-View-ViewModel data binding scenarios.

                <h3>TabControl Data Binding</h3>
                <p>TabControls are probably not something you think about first and foremost as a data-bound control, because
                    they're often used for structurally setting up some static content in child views within a window.
                </p>
                <p>But TabControls are also good for dynamic view containment scenarios, when the set of child views that you want
                    to present is dynamically driven by data. To support this, a TabControl is derived from ItemsControl so each
                    of the tabs is an item that is rendered out, similar to ListBox items in a ListBox.
                </p>
                <p>But each TabItem that gets rendered out is really a composite object itself. It contains two pieces of content,
                    and in fact, they're implemented as two separate ContentControls.
                </p>
                <p> First off, there is the header. That's what shows up in the little tab at the top, which can, naturally, be
                    put on the sides or bottom if you need to. Then there's the actual client area of the tab, the main part of
                    the tab, if you will, and that's called Content.
                </p>
                <p>To drive these dynamically, there's two DataTemplates associated with a TabControl. The ItemTemplate actually
                    applies to the header of each TabItem, and then there's a separate ContentTemplate that applies to the Content
                    of each TabItem.
                </p>
                <p>So let's take a look at a demo of how we can use this to compose dynamic child views into a containing main
                    view using a TabControl, DataTemplates, and data binding.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I want to get you familiar with TabControls and how they can be used with data binding. Starting
                    point for this is a WPF project with a MainWindow and a MainWindowViewModel:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-097.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and then a ProductView, which is a UserControl in its own associated ViewModel.</p>
                <p>The ViewModel for the ProductViewModel is just loading up products into a Products property on the ViewModel:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-098.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Which can be rendered out in a list-oriented control. In addition, it has a ProductType string</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-099.png" class="image"/>
                <p>That can be used to label what kind of products this view is rendering.</p>
                <p>The view itself is just going to use a ListBox to render out those products:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-100.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and notice that no DataContext is set inside the UserControl because it's going to be set dynamically through
                    data binding.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-101.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The individual products are being rendered out using a DataTemplate:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-102.png" class="image"/>
                <p>specifically an ImplicitDataTemplate for the DataType Product.</p>
                <p>The MainWindowViewModel, at this point, just has a property called ChildViewModels, which is a collection of
                    those ProductViewModels.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-103.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So the scenario here is that we want to render out individual tabs in a TabControl for different categories of
                    products or ProductTypes. So using data binding, we're going to create a collection of ChildViewModels here,
                    one for each ProductType, and have data binding render out the appropriate View and ViewModel in a tab for
                    each one of those.
                </p>
                <p>To do that, we'll need a TabControl. So let's drop into the MainWindow and add a TabControl</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-104.png" class="image"/>
                <p> bound to that ChildViewModel's property on its ViewModel, which is already wired up as the DataContext. Next,
                    we need to actually populate that ChildViewModels collection with something, so I'm going to drop into the
                    constructor of the ViewModel here and populate it with an ObservableCollection.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-105.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We're putting one instance of the ProductViewModel in for each of the three ProductTypes that are in our
                    Products collection, pizza, salads, and drinks. ProductViewModel takes that Type that's passed in and uses it
                    to set the ProductType property:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-106.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and then notice it's filtering the products that it loads into that ViewModel, based on that Type.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-107.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So now we have a TabControl, which is an ItemsControl itself, bound to a collection of items:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-108.png" class="image"/>
                <p>but it needs to know how to render those items out, and it's going to do that with DataTemplates.</p>
                <p>So we're going to go up here to our Resources section and add in a DataTemplate:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-109.png" class="image"/>
                <p>an ImplicitDataTemplate, mapped to the ProductViewModel Type, which is going to be the individual items that
                    show up in this ChildViewModels collection.
                </p>
                <p>And similar to a demo in the DataTemplates module, the actual rendering for a ProductViewModel will be its
                    corresponding view, and its DataContext will be set to that instance of the ViewModel through the magic of how
                    DataTemplates work.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-110.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now if we run at this point, we're going to see this strange-looking view:</p>
                <p>where we actually have tabs here, you can see I can click on them and the appearance is changing, but what's
                    actually happening is that view is being rendered in the tab itself, the tab header, and we don't have a
                    scrolling container, so we can't see it, but it's actually rendering them again as the content of the tab, not
                    exactly what we wanted.
                </p>
                <p>The reason for this is, a TabControl is an ItemsControl</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-111.png" class="image"/>
                <p>but it's really a composite ItemsControl, it's going to render a TabItem for each of the items in its
                    data-bound source, but a TabItem itself has two parts to it, it has a header and it has content. The header is
                    a ContentControl and the Content is a ContentControl, and the DataContext for the TabItem as a whole is the
                    individual thing that's being rendered, in this case a ProductViewModel.
                </p>
                <p>So, the data binding in the content of the header binds to that, and the data binding in the content of the
                    main client area of the tab, also binds to that. So what we need to do here is control this a little more
                    explicitly.
                </p>
                <p>What I'll do is I'll drop into my Resources and add another DataTemplate.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-112.png" class="image"/>
                <p>This one's going to have a key to it so we can point to it explicitly and we'll call this the
                    TabHeaderTemplate. Here you can see we're just going to bind to ProductType because the overall DataContext
                    for the TabItem is still going to be the ViewModel and that's the property exposed from it.
                </p>
                <p>Now we need to go down here to our TabControl and actually pull that template in by name. So we'll set the
                    ItemTemplate property through a StaticResource, pointing to that TabHeaderTemplate.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-113.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now, notice if we wanted to do the other one explicitly, we could do that, and what we would use is the
                    ContentTemplate property:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-114.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and point it to whatever template we want, but since we're using an ImplicitDataTemplate here we don't have to
                    do that one.
                </p>
                <p>That one can match up implicitly, but if you have an explicit one hooked up, it will ignore the implicit ones.
                    So with that fix in place, now we've got what we want.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-115.png" class="image"/>
                <p>We've got the TabHeaders are being set based on the ProductType property of our ViewModel, the Tab content is
                    being set to an instance of the ViewModel, which gets married up through the DataTemplate to its view, and
                    rendered out.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>DataGrid Features</h3>
                <p>Now let's talk about the ubiquitous DataGrid. DataGrids are obviously a mainstay of data binding scenarios and
                    presenting data collections in tabular form.
                </p>
                <p>They are ItemsControls themselves, so all the things we've said about ItemsControls apply to them as well.
                    DataGrids are editable. They have an edit mode and a normal mode. When you click in a cell in a row, it goes
                    into edit mode and stays there until you click out of that row.
                </p>
                <p>DataGrids support dynamic column generation, so they can reflect on the data-bound objects and generate a
                    column for each property on that object, but most commonly you're going to use static column definitions,
                    setting up exactly what columns you want, in the order you want them, bound to the properties you intend.
                </p>
                <p>You can also use templated columns, which we'll look into in more detail. Templating really comes in at two
                    different levels. For the column level, it really amounts to cell level. You define a template column, and
                    that's specifying the visual structure of each cell within that column.
                </p>
                <p>There are separate templates that you can set for normal versus edit mode, in case you want to toggle, for
                    example, render something as text when you're not in edit mode, and then switch to a ComboBox when you are in
                    edit mode.
                </p>
                <p>There's also a RowDetails template that you can provide on the DataGrid as a whole, and this lets you provide a
                    DataTemplate to render out the child detail for a given row in whatever way that you want.
                </p>
                <p>You could render out a data form, a child DataGrid or whatever makes sense for your scenario. An important
                    concept surrounding DataGrids and data binding is to realize that DataGrid columns are not part of the visual
                    tree.
                </p>
                <p>So earlier in this module we looked at the breakdown of the visual tree and the dynamic generation of
                    ItemsPresenters and ContentPresenters, and we saw that there are no columns rendered out as part of that tree.
                </p>
                <p>On a DataGrid column, however, you will declare bindings. Those bindings are actually kind of held aside and
                    used at the point where it goes to render a cell. At the point where the binding is first evaluated, it's when
                    it's parsing the DataGrid and the columns contained within it.
                </p>
                <p>Since that column is not part of the visual tree, things like RelativeSource bindings and ElementName bindings
                    that try to walk throughout the tree to find the source object, are not going to work properly as part of a
                    column.
                </p>
                <p>In a demo, I'll show you how you can use templated columns to address that and still have the power and
                    flexibility you need to use RelativeSource or ElementName bindings when you want as part of a column
                    definition. So let's dive into a demo to get more familiar with all these aspects of DataGrids.

                <p>In this demo, I want to get you more familiar with some of the more detailed features of DataGrids. Now
                    DataGrids are a big topic. You could easily spend a whole module drilling into all kinds of esoteric details
                    about DataGrids. I just want to hit the high points here and the things you're going to use most commonly in
                    data binding scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>Our starting point here is a simple WPF project with a MainWindow:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-116.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and the only thing that's really been added here is a little bit of data access code that's going out at
                    runtime and getting a Customers collection populated:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-117.png" class="image"/>
                <p>that's exposed from the code-behind as a DependencyProperty that has an ObservableCollection.</p>
                <p>Notice it's also drilling down and getting the related Orders for those Customers:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-118.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which we'll use later in the demo, and it's also populating a States property:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-119.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which is a collection of the state abbreviations, and that's all that's in the code-behind here.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-120.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now especially when it comes to putting together a DataGrid, I find using the Data Sources Window to generate
                    the columns for me is very handy.
                </p>
                <p>Generally, you're not going to want to auto-generate the columns, because they won't be in the right order and
                    they includes certain properties you don't want to display, so you're going to need explicitly-defined
                    columns, and doing each one by hand in the XAML Editor is a lot of work.
                </p>
                <p>Using the Data Sources Window, as I showed in a previous module, and go add a data source:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-121.png" class="image"/>
                <p>point to the object type that you want, get it into the tree here:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-122.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and then just drag-and-drop to generate the DataGrid and all of its columns.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-123.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now in this case I don't actually want all of those columns, and I want them in a different order. So
                    afterwards, I'm going to drop into the XAML and move some things around and delete a few columns.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-124.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I'm just going to do that all quickly here with cut and paste, and we get it down to Id, FirstName, LastName,
                    Phone, and Email, and lastly, a State column.
                </p>
                <p>I'm going to make one other modification up here at the root level, I'm going to set the DataContext of the
                    MainWindow to itself. So we saw this in earlier demos using a RelativeSource binding to Self:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-125.png" class="image"/>
                <p>meaning that the DataContext is the window itself, so the bindings within the view can point to properties in
                    the code-behind of the window, something you can do when you're not doing the MVVM pattern.
                </p>
                <p>Next, I'm going to take the CollectionViewSource that was generated through the drag/drop and make a
                    modification to it:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-126.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Setting the Source property equal to the Customers property that's being exposed from the code-behind.</p>
                <p>With that in place, I can go ahead and run:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-127.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and we've got our basic data-bound DataGrid scenario. Keep in mind, a DataGrid is editable, by default, so I
                    can go in here and start editing things. There's properties you can set to make it read-only.
                </p>
                <p>Also, at the bottom, a DataGrid always has a new entry row, by default:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-128.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and again, you can set a property to get rid of that if you don't expect people to add new items from the Grid.
                    The basic properties in play here are, of course, ItemsSource:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-129.png" class="image"/>
                <p>because it is an ItemsControl; AutoGenerateColumns False:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-130.png" class="image"/>
                <p>because we're explicitly declaring them, if you forget and leave that True, you'll get duplicate columns; and
                    then you declare a column for each column that you want in your DataGrid.
                </p>
                <p>Now the important thing, as I pointed out in a previous demo, is that these columns:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-131.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Don't actually exist at runtime. They're a declaration used to generate cells within a row that represent a
                    column, but the Column objects here are just objects, they're not actually part of the visual tree.
                </p>
                <p>So that might raise the question of how can they have bindings on them then? Well, the Binding property here:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-132.png" class="image"/>
                <p>is really creating a Binding object, which is held in this Binding property. It's then used to set the binding
                    on whatever element will be generated within a cell, within a row representing that column. It's not actually
                    evaluated at a column level when the DataGrid is being built, only down at a cell level.
                </p>
                <p>Now these Width properties:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-133.png" class="image"/>
                <p>are ones you can set size to Header, by default, but you can see it supports *, Auto, and explicit sizing as
                    well.
                </p>
                <p>Now when you do your drag-and-drop, it's going to assume everything is just plain text, but you might want a
                    more complicated rendering.
                </p>
                <p>There's other built-in column types such as a DataGridComboBoxColumn:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-134.png" class="image"/>
                <p>DataGridCheckBoxColumns, and so on. Now this DataGridComboBoxColumn may seen tempting, but it's actually a
                    little hard to work with at times because you need to set the ItemsSource to the collection of things that's
                    going to show up in the ComboBox, such as our list of states.
                </p>
                <p>But the overall DataContext, when this actually results in rendering a cell, is just going to be a single
                    Customer object in this case. And unless you hang the collection of states off of each Customer object, the
                    ItemsSource property can't get to it through a DataContext binding.
                </p>
                <p>Well, you might be tempted to try what I did here and use a RelativeSource binding:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-135.png" class="image"/>
                <p>walking up the visual tree to the parent DataGrid, because after all, this is a ComboBoxColumn inside of a
                    Columns collection on the DataGrid, it should be able to walk that tree, right?
                </p>
                <p>Well, not so much, because again, these columns aren't part of the visual tree at runtime, they're used to
                    generate things at a row and cell level that are part of the visual tree, but the ComboBoxColumn itself is
                    not.
                </p>
                <p>So this RelativeSource binding basically won't work out. It does expose other properties, such as
                    SelectedItemBinding
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-136.png" class="image"/>
                <p>which corresponds to the SelectedItem property for the ComboBox that will be rendered out. As long as you can
                    get a valid binding in there, that'll work fine, as well as SelectedValueBinding, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>But if we run right now, you can see that our State column looks kind of empty initially:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-137.png" class="image"/>
                <p>If we click on it and go into edit mode, then it does actually render like a ComboBox, but the ComboBox is
                    empty.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-138.png" class="image"/>
                <p>What do want to do when your binding is not doing exactly what you expect it to do? Go look at your output
                    window. Down here in the output window, we can see a System.Windows.Data Error:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-139.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and it says, Cannot find source for binding 'RelativeSource FindAncestor', and it's looking for a DataGrid.</p>
                <p>The hard part is, there's nothing in this error message that's really going to tip you off if you haven't seen
                    this video or learned about it somewhere else. The problem is that the DataGrid column is not part of the
                    visual tree, so it's not able to walk up and find that DataGrid because it's just not there at the point where
                    this binding is being evaluated.
                </p>
                <p>So, what we can do instead is use a TemplatedColumn:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-140.png" class="image"/>
                <p>TemplatedColumn is a very important concept in DataGrids because it gives you full control over exactly what
                    the visual that will be rendered inside of a cell is.
                </p>
                <p>At the TemplatedColumn level, you can still set the Header that will be shown at the top of the Grid and the
                    Width of the column, but everything else will be driven by what you put in the CellTemplate:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-141.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I should mention there's also a CellEditingTemplate property on the column if you want a different visual
                    rendering for edit mode versus non-edit mode.
                </p>
                <p>If you don't set that, it'll use whatever is in the CellTemplate for both modes. CellTemplate is nothing more
                    than a DataTemplate that you can put whatever visual structuring in you want.
                </p>
                <p>So, here we use an actual ComboBox:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-142.png" class="image"/>
                <p>with all of its normal ComboBox properties, and in this case, we can use a RelativeSourceBinding, and that's
                    because this ComboBox doesn't come into being until the DataTemplate is rendered within a cell, that cell is
                    in a row, the row is in the DataGrid, so the RelativeSource is actually able to walk up the visual tree and
                    get to whatever it's pointing to.
                </p>
                <p>So in this case, I'll point it to the Window level, to the DataContext property, which will be the Window
                    itself, to the States property that's exposed on that.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-143.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So it's able to use that to get the list of states to render in the ComboBox and then we do the SelectedItem
                    Binding:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-144.png" class="image"/>
                <p>against the current DataContext, which is a Customer object.</p>
                <p>So we grab the State property off that Customer object to drive what's selected. With that in place, we can
                    run, resize our window, and we can see off to the right our ComboBoxes are there:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-145.png" class="image"/>
                <p>rendering as ComboBoxes interactive all the time, even before you click into the row and get it in edit mode.
                </p>
                <p>And we can see that they show the list of items and are data-bound to that.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-146.png" class="image"/>
                <p>When we set those, they're setting the SelectedItem, which is bound to the state of the Customer and it
                    actually sets that on the Customer.
                </p>
                <p>Another last capability to highlight here in DataGrids, is the ability to provide a RowDetailTemplate:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-147.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So I'm going to pop in here another property on the DataGrid, RowDetailsTemplate, which is just a DataTemplate
                    that will be rendered out as a child panel on each row when it's selected by default.
                </p>
                <p>It's driven by a property at the DataGrid level called RowDetailsVisibilityMode:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-148.png" class="image"/>
                <p>You can set this to collapsed and then programmatically toggle it, or you can use this VisibleWhenSelected.</p>
                <p>And what you put inside of that DataTemplate is totally up to you. The DataContext for the DataTemplate is
                    going to be the RowDataContext, which means a Customer in our current case.
                </p>
                <p>So, because we populated the child Orders for a Customer in the query in the code-behind:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-149.png" class="image"/>
                <p>it means that we can bind to that as a property hanging off of the current DataContext for a given row, which
                    will be the customer.
                </p>
                <p>In this case, I'm just going to cheat and say, AutoGenerateColumns True, but in a real scenario you'd want to
                    explicitly declare just the columns that you want. But this could be a little data entry form, some sort of
                    rendering of the properties of an individual object hanging off of the current row object, such as an address
                    for the customer or so on.
                </p>
                <p>So let's go ahead and run with that. Let's also resize our Gird, do a Reset Layout, All, so it fills the window
                    here, and go ahead and run:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-150.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now we can see the first row is selected, so we see this child DataGrid containing the orders, and as we select
                    each row we see a child DataGrid with the orders for that item.
                </p>
                <p>Obviously, it needs some prettying up with some margins, some backgrounds, you probably want to get rid of the
                    input row for the child items, and so on, but you can see through a DataTemplate you can put whatever you want
                    in that child panel when the row is selected. So those are all the key things you want to know about working
                    with DataGrids and data binding.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <h3>Collection Views</h3>
                <p>Now let's talk about some of the other things you can do with CollectionViewSources. We've seen these in a
                    number of demos so far, especially those generated by the drag-and-drops from the Data Sources Window.
                </p>
                <p>And we mentioned them in a previous module when talking about the ICollectionView interface. So, first off, a
                    CollectionViewSource wraps a collection by pointing to it through its Source property, and then you can use
                    the CollectionViewSource as a collection for data binding. A CollectionViewSource exposes an ICollectionView.
                </p>
                <p>So if you want to deal with the ICollectionView, typically for something like maintaining what is the current
                    object or moving the cursor of what the current object is around in the collection, you can do that with the
                    ICollectionView interface, exposed through a .View property on a CollectionViewSource.
                </p>
                <p>But what we're going to focus on here, is that you can also use the CollectionViewSource to morph or change the
                    rendered data collection, and use it to sort the data collection, filter which items are presented, or group
                    the items. Additionally, CollectionViewSources are very handy for Master-Detail scenarios, being able to chain
                    together a parent collection to a child collection, to a grandchild collection, and so on, and render those
                    out nicely based on user selections in the view.
                </p>
                <p>The way you do this is by chaining them, so you set up multiple CollectionViewSources and you set the source of
                    one CollectionViewSource to a parent CollectionViewSource and use a property path to indicate what properties
                    on the current object in that parent CollectionViewSource should drive the child CollectionViewSource.
                </p>
                <p>So let's see how we can sort, filter, and group in one demo, and how we can set up Master-Details in another
                    demo.

                </div>
                <p>In this demo, I want to get you familiar with some of the extra things that a CollectionViewSource can do for
                    you when working with data-bound collections, specifically sorting, filtering, and grouping.
                </p>
                <p>Starting point here is the end of our last demo working with DataGrids. I'm going to take my DataGrid and pull
                    it down from the top a little bit so that I have room to add some buttons:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-151.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I'm going to drop into the UI here and add a button, its content is set to Sort:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-152.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and we're going to hook up an OnSort method in the code-behind. Our OnSort handler here, you can see, is going
                    to reach out and find that customersViewSource that's up in the XAML.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-153.png" class="image"/>
                <p>This is the one that was generated through drag-and-drop and slightly modified in the last demo, but it's
                    pointing to the Customers collection exposed from the Window code-behind, which is our DataContext:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-154.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So once we have a reference to a CollectionViewSource:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-155.png" class="image"/>
                <p>it exposes a number of methods and properties we can use to modify the collection it exposes for data binding
                    purposes, first of which is a SortDescriptions property.
                </p>
                <p>It's a collection of SortDescriptions that supports multi-sorting, and we just add new SortDescription objects
                    into it, telling it what property to sort on and what direction to sort.
                </p>
                <p>So just simply by adding that and hooking that up to a button, we can go ahead and run, and we can see I will
                    click on the Sort property:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-156.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and now things are sorted by state:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-157.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now there is a slightly different way to go about this using CollectionViews, instead of the
                    CollectionViewSource explicitly:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-158.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So I could comment out the line of code that went directly to the SortDescriptions property of the
                    CollectionViewSource, and instead use the .View property on the CollectionViewSource to get a reference to the
                    ICollectionView interface.
                </p>
                <p>We've seen this one in previous demos in an earlier module and we used it to drive the current object within
                    the collection and to be able to move that cursor, if you will, for the current object, forward and backward
                    to select different items in the collection. Well the CollectionView is really the thing that knows how to do
                    the sorting, and it really exposes the same API.
                </p>
                <p>It has a SortDescriptions collection:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-159.png" class="image"/>
                <p>that you can add new SortDescriptions into, and do the exact same thing that we were doing directly on the
                    SortDescriptions here. By doing it through ICollectionView, you're not coupled to whether you're actually
                    using a CollectionViewSource or not.
                </p>
                <p>I showed in a previous demo, there's always an ICollectionView under the covers you can get to through
                    GetDefaultView. So we could sort through that, even if we're not using a CollectionViewSource. Functionality
                    here is exactly the same.
                </p>
                <p>Now another thing I might want to do is filter my data based on some criteria. So I'm going to drop down here
                    and add another button, which will show up at the top, called Filter:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-160.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and it's going to target a method we'll add in the code-behind called OnFilter. I'll drop in the code-behind
                    and add that method:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-161.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and you can see what the API looks like here is, again, we reach out and get a reference to our
                    CollectionViewSource. That CollectionViewSource has an event on it called Filter:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-162.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and when you hook up a subscriber to that event it's going to trigger it to reevaluate its collection, fire
                    that event once for each object:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-163.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and let your event handler decide whether to include that object or not.</p>
                <p>So you can see the event handler takes in a FilterEventArgs. Inside of that EventArgs is an item, which is the
                    data-bound object it's evaluating, and you're expected to return a Boolean through the Accepted property of
                    the EventArg. So here I'm just inspecting, is the State equal to Alaska? If so, I set Accepted to true and it
                    will be presented, otherwise, I set it to false.
                </p>
                <p>So I can go ahead and run this, expand so we can see our states a little better, hit the filter, and now we see
                    only Alaska.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-164.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now, of course, the way this is wired up right now, we would be re-subscribing each time I click on the button,
                    so you'd want to structure that a little bit differently and do it one time as the view initializes. I just
                    wanted to keep it all local here for demo purposes.
                </p>
                <p> Now, again, if you go through the CollectionView, there's a little bit different way to get it hooked up
                    here
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-165.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So we could get to our CollectionViewSource and get to its underlying ICollectionView.</p>
                <p>And then, instead of the event-based model, which I've always kind of hated events where you're expected to set
                    properties on the EventArgs to make things happen by the caller. It kind of violates the fire-and-forget
                    notion of events, so I'm not a big fan of this event-based way of doing it.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-166.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The ICollectionView way is a little bit more explicit. What you set is a Filter property on the view.</p>
                <p>The Filter property is set to a delegate type that's called Predicate. Predicate takes in an object:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-167.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and returns a Boolean.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-168.png" class="image"/>
                <p>And basically, the Filter Predicate will be evaluated once for each object in the collection any time you set
                    the Filter property or you change the underlying collection. So this is just a little bit more explicit that
                    you pass in an item and you return a Boolean to say yes or no whether you should include it.
                </p>
                <p>In this case, I'm doing Arizona instead of Alaska.</p>
                <p>So with that hooked up, I can run, and we'll see the exact same behavior, just for a different state, click on
                    Filter, and now we just have the two Arizona customers.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-169.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Lastly, through the CollectionViewSource you can do grouping. So I'll add another button in my UI here to Group
                    objects:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-170.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and I'll drop into the code-behind and add a handler for that OnGroup method.</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-171.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Similar thing, I need to get a reference to my CollectionViewSource and it exposes a GroupDescriptions
                    property. Now this one I'm not going to show, but there is a way to go down through the ICollectionView and it
                    has a GroupDescriptions property as well.
                </p>
                <p>Here we just add a new PropertyGroupDescription, tell it what property it's based on, and it's going to start
                    grouping based on that property. If we go ahead and run with that, click on Group, now we can see the
                    groupings of states over on the right.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-172.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Now just having them grouped like that may not be enough visual indication, so the DataGrid and ListView
                    controls in WPF support styling based on that group. So I can go back to my XAML here, go up to my DataGrid,
                    and add a property called GroupStyle to the DataGrid, setting it to a GroupStyle instance:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-173.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and the GroupStyle can have various things in it, but one of the things it has is a HeaderTemplate. That's just
                    a DataTemplate that you can put whatever you want in it.
                </p>
                <p>Now the DataContext for this is not going to be a RowObject, it's actually going to be the Group itself, which
                    will have its Name property set based on the Group that it's rendering.
                </p>
                <p>So the binding is generally going to be Name here, but with that in place we can go ahead and run again:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-174.png" class="image"/>
                <p>click on Group, and now we see it puts these bands in here in between the groups and renders out our
                    GroupStyleTemplate.
                </p>
                <p>Obviously, you could put some better visual structure to that to make it prettier, but that's how you deal with
                    sorting, filtering, and grouping using the CollectionViewSource.
                </p>

                <p>The last I want to show here with respect to CollectionViewSources is how you can use it to drive a
                    Master-Details presentation of related collections and objects. My starting point here is a basic WPF project.

                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-178.png" class="image"/>
                <p>As we've seen in a previous module, I can start at the root level with Customer, drag-and-drop, and generate a
                    grid.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-179.png" class="image"/>
                <p>I'm going to resize that grid to fit towards the top here. Now, for the related Orders and OrderItems, it might
                    be tempting to drag out from this level:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-180.png" class="image"/>
                <p>but if you do you're generating a DataGrid that's bound to an independent collection of orders or OrderItems.
                </p>
                <p>What you want to do is drill down to the property on a Customer that is the Orders collection related to that
                    customer.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-181.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Do your drag-and-drop from there, and the designer will do the right thing, which we'll show the code for in a
                    moment, to generate a different CollectionViewSource, but to tie that CollectionViewSource to the parent
                    CollectionViewSource:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-182.png" class="image"/>
                <p>Likewise, I can drill down another level to OrderItems:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-183.png" class="image"/>
                <p>drag that out, and have that related to the parent Orders collection. And then we could go one level down to
                    the related Product, switch that to use the Details view:
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-184.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and generate a little data form for the current product:</p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-185.png" class="image"/>
                <p>and I won't worry about the fact that it's being clipped off there.</p>
                <p>With that code in place, it also generated the Loaded event handler and all I've got to do is go set the Source
                    property for the root customerViewSource to my Customers collection that I populated on construction.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-186.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So with that in place, I can run, and notice that we have the, not very well laid out, but we have customers up
                    above. Whatever customer I select, we're seeing the orders for that customer in the next grid down. Whatever
                    order I select, I'm seeing the order details, and whatever order detail I select, I'm seeing the related
                    product.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-187.png" class="image"/>
                <p>So a typical chained Master-Details kind of setup, all in seconds with drag-and-drop. Now let's look at the
                    XAML that it generated, because that's where all the action is. And the magic key really has to do with these
                    CollectionViewSources.
                </p>
                <img src="app/wpf/images/wpfdatabindingindepth/Fig07-188.png" class="image"/>
                <p>The first one was generated from the drag-and-drop of the CustomerEntityType, and we've talked through that
                    before, that it sets it up, says it going to be dealing with Customer, and that's the one that we're
                    populating from the code-behind at runtime.
                </p>
                <p>Where the Master-Details happens here is, notice the Source of the second one it generated for Orders. Its set
                    to a Binding whose Source is explicitly set to be the CollectionViewSource up above for the Customers. That
                    Customers collection is going to have a current item in it, as we've talked about before, and that current
                    item is going to have an Orders property. So the path on this Binding is to the Orders property of the current
                    item in that collection.
                </p>
                <p>Likewise, for the OrderItemsViewSource it's pointing to the OrdersViewSource into the OrderItems property on
                    the current item in that OrdersViewSource. Notice there's not a separate CollectionViewSource for the Product.
                </p>
                <p>When I generated the grid containing the data entry fields for the product, it set the DataContext for that
                    grid to the OrderItemsViewSource, which again, is going to have a current item that's an OrderItem. And then
                    it generated the bindings on the individual fields to use the property Product.Description,
                    Product.HasOptions, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>So you can see through the currency that's managed by an ICollectionview, which a CollectionViewSource has
                    under the covers, whenever the current item changes, if there's another CollectionViewSource that's bound to
                    that collection in the current item, it can get to the properties of that current item and use that to drive a
                    separate CollectionViewSource, and so on down the chain.
                </p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Okay, in this module we went through a lot about container controls and the dynamic generation of child
                    controls based on data binding, as well as collection controls and how they really worked.
                </p>
                <p>So first we looked at ContentControls and ItemsControls and their pivotal role in the dynamic UI composition
                    based on data binding. We saw that ContentControls render out ContentPresenters, and it's inside the
                    ContentPresenter that the actual data-driven content, such as a DataTemplate, gets rendered.
                </p>
                <p>Likewise, in an ItemsControl, an ItemsControl will render out an ItemsPresenter, and that ItemsPresenter will
                    be responsible for rendering out individual item containers. Inside those containers, eventually, are often
                    ContentPresenters that show the content for an individual DataObject.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we reviewed ComboBoxes and ListBoxes, mainstays of data binding, and just made sure you were familiar
                    with all the key properties associated with data binding, including ItemsSource, DisplayMemberPath,
                    SelectedValuePath, SelectedValue, SelectedItem, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>Next, we took a look at TabControls and you saw that they can be data-driven as well, especially for dynamic
                    child view containment scenarios. They can point to a collection of ViewModels or data objects that are going
                    to be rendered through a DataTemplate, and the views that get rendered inside the tabs can be driven by
                    DataTemplates, as well as a DataTemplate to render the header in the top part of the tab that shows at the top
                    of a TabControl by default.
                </p>
                <p>We drilled into DataGrids and got familiar with the key properties associated with data bindings and the things
                    you could do there. We covered the fact that DataGrids are really just an ItemsControl that's going to render
                    out rows for each of the items in the data-bound collection. DataGrids are defined through columns, but the
                    columns aren't really part of the DataGrid at runtime, as I emphasized.
                </p>
                <p>Column definitions result in rows and cells being rendered. So the bindings you specify at a column level,
                    really result in cell-level container bindings at runtime. AS a result, certain kinds of bindings won't work
                    in columns, specifically RelativeSource bindings and ElementName bindings.
                </p>
                <p>For those, you can use a CellTemplate. CellTemplate gives you full control of exactly what's going in to a
                    cell, you define a DataTemplate that contains the content you want to see in that cell, and that DataTemplate
                    can contain whatever bindings relative to the DataContext of the row that you want.
                </p>
                <p>So if the row is a customer, you can point to properties on the customer and any normal data binding should
                    work there, including RelativeSource bindings and ElementName bindings because the cells are part of the
                    visual tree, the columns are not.
                </p>
                <p>We also looked at the fact that DataGrid RowDetailTemplates allow you to provide a child panel that shows up
                    associated with each row that you can populate with the DataTemplate with whatever structure you want in
                    there.
                </p>
                <p>It could contain an entire data form, it could contain a child DataGrid, anything you want to put in there, the
                    DataContext for that RowDetailTemplate will be the data-bound row object, such as a customer, and you can use
                    any properties hanging off that customer to render out child details in that panel.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, we finished off with CollectionViewSource and you saw that it gives you a very nice, easy-to-use way
                    to sort, filter, group, and do master-detail type setups when working with collections or multiple collections
                    in your views.
